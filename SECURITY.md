# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
TripleA is addressing vulnerabilities in the product for the current and the previous releases (a release is anything that increases either the major or the minor version part, in a semver understanding) of the last twelve months.

We highly recommend anyone using a version that is older than twelve months or the last two releases to upgrade as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are grateful for anyone reporting a vulnerability, helping us to make TripleA better and more secure. Additionally, we encourage everyone to disclose bugs in a responsible way, allowing us and other TripleA users to react accordingly in a timely manner. That means:

- If you want to report a security bug, [open an issue on github](https://github.com/EhsanBitaraf/triple-a/issues/new).
- This is an open source project. If you discover a bug and fix it, you are very welcome to submit a PR.
