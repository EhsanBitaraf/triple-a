# triple-a
*Article Analysis Assistant*

This program somehow creates a network of article references and provides a connection between authors and keywords, these things are usually called "[**Citation Graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_graph)".

There are various software and online systems for this, a brief review of which can be found [here](docs/related-work.md).

This tool gives you the power to create a graph of articles and analyze it. This tool is designed as a **CLI** (command-line interface) and you can use it as a Python library.

        file.write(article.Title  + "\n")
```

### Training NER for Article Title

You can use NLP(Natural Language Processing) methods to extract information from the structure of the article and add it to your graph. For example, you can extract NER(Named-entity recognition) words from the title of the article and add to the graph. [Here's how to create a custom NER](docs/training-ner.md).



## Command Line (CLI) Use

By using the following command, you can see the command completion `help`. Each command has a separate `help`.

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py  --help
```

output:

![](docs/assets/img/aaa-help.png)


### Get and Save list of article identifier base on search term

Get list of article identifier (PMID) base on search term and save into knowledge repository in first state (0):

use this command:
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py search --searchterm [searchterm]
```

Even the PMID itself can be used in the search term.
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py search --searchterm 36467335
```

output:

![](docs/assets/img/aaa-search.png)

### Move core pipeline state
The preparation of the article for extracting the graph has different steps that are placed in a pipeline. Each step is identified by a number in the state value. The following table describes the state number:

*List of state number*

|State|Description|
|-|-|
|0|article identifier saved|
|1|article details article info saved (json Form)|
|2|parse details info|
|3|Get Citation|
|4|NER Title|
|5|extract graph|
|-1|Error|


There are two ways to run a pipeline. In the first method, we give the number of the existing state and all the articles in this state move forward one state.
In another method, we give the final state number and each article under that state starts to move until it reaches the final state number that we specified.
The first can be executed with the `next` command and the second with the `go` command.

With this command move from current state to the next state
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py next --state [current state]
```

for example move all article in state 0 to 1:
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py next --state 0
```
output:

![](docs/assets/img/aaa-next.png)


`go` command:
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py go --end [last state]
```

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py go --end 3
```

output:

![](docs/assets/img/aaa-go.png)


### Run custom pipeline
Apart from the core pipelines that should be used to prepare articles, customized pipelines can also be used. Custom pipelines may be implemented to extract knowledge from texts and NLP processing. These pipelines themselves can form a new graph other than the citation graph or in combination with it.


List of Custom Pipeline

|Action|Tag Name|Description|
|------|--------|-----------|
|Triple extraction from article abstract|FlagExtractKG||
|Topic extraction from article abstract|FlagExtractTopic||
|Convert Affiliation text to structural data|FlagAffiliationMining|This is simple way for parse Affiliation text |
|Convert Affiliation text to structural data|FlagAffiliationMining_Titipata|use [Titipat Achakulvisut Repo](https://github.com/titipata/affiliation_parser) for parsing Affiliation text|

#### NER Article Title
You can try the NER method to extract the major topic of the article's title by using the following command. This command is independent and is used for testing and is not stored in the Arepo.

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\ner.py --title "The Iranian Integrated Care Electronic Health Record."
```

#### Country-based Co-authorship
A country-based co-authorship network refers to a network of collaborative relationships between researchers from different countries who have co-authored academic papers together. It represents the connections and collaborations that exist among researchers across national boundaries.

By studying a country-based co-authorship network, researchers can gain insights into international collaborations, identify emerging research trends, foster interdisciplinary cooperation, and facilitate policy decisions related to research funding, academic mobility, and scientific development at a global scale.

There are several software tools available that can help you produce country-based co-authorship networks. Here are a few popular options:

[VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/): VOSviewer is a widely used software tool for constructing and visualizing co-authorship networks. It offers various clustering and visualization techniques and allows you to analyze and explore the network based on different attributes, including country affiliation.

[Sci2 Tool](https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php): The Science of Science (Sci2) Tool is a Java-based software package (in [GitHub](https://github.com/CIShell)) that supports the analysis and visualization of scientific networks. It offers a variety of functionalities for constructing and analyzing co-authorship networks, including country-based analysis. It allows users to perform data preprocessing, network analysis, and visualization within a single integrated environment.



To convert affiliation into a hierarchical structure of country, city and centers, you can use the following command:

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py pipeline -n FlagAffiliationMining
```


#### Extract Triple from Abstract

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py pipeline --name FlagExtractKG
```



#### Extract Topic from Abstract

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py pipeline --name FlagExtractTopic
```

An example of working with the functions of this part using `Jupyter` is given in [here](./jupyter_lab/selection-sampling.ipynb). which is finally drawn using VOSviewer program as below:

![](./docs/assets/img/topic-graph-biobank.png)

### Import Data

#### Import Single Reference File
Import file type is `.bib` , `.enw` , `.ris`

```shell
python .\triplea\cli\importbib.py "C:\...\bc.ris"
```

output:

![](docs/assets/img/import-output.png)


#### Import Triplea Format

```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py import --help
```


```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py import --type triplea --format json --bar True "C:\BibliometricAnalysis.json"
```


### Export Data
Various data export can be created from the article repository. These outputs are used to create raw datasets.

|Type|Format|
|-|-|
|triplea|json, csv , *csvs*|
|rayyan|csv|
|RefMan*|ris|


* It has not yet been implemented.


For guidance from the export command, you can act like this:
```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --help
```

For Example :




The export is limited to 100 samples, and the resulting exported articles are saved in the file Triple Json format named "test_export.json".
```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --type triplea --format json --limit 100 --output "test_export.json"
```


```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --type triplea --format json --output "test_export.json"
```

Export Triplea CSV format:
```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --type triplea --format csv --output "test_export.csv"
```


```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --type triplea --format csvs --output "export.csv"
```


Export for Rayyan CSV format:
```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py export --type rayyan --format csv --output "test_export.csv"
```

### Work with Article Repository
Article Repository (Arepo) is a database that stores the information of articles and graphs. Different databases can be used. We have used the following information banks here:

- [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) - TinyDB is a lightweight document oriented database

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program


To get general information about the articles, nodes and egdes in the database, use the following command.
```shell
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py arepo -c info
```

output:
```shell
Number of article in article repository is 122
0 Node(s) in article repository.
0 Edge(s) in article repository.
122 article(s) in state 3.
```



Get article data by PMID
```sh
python .\triplea\cli\aaa.py arepo -pmid 31398071
```

output:
```

You can download the result of this network and the relationship between the article and the keyword in `graphdict` format from [**here**](datasets/bcancer-graphdict.json). Manipulated, you can download this graph in `gramphml` format from [**here**](datasets/bcancer.graphml).

## EHR
It is not yet complete.

# Graph Visualization 
Various tools have been developed to visualize graphs. We have done a [brief review](docs/graph-visualization.md) and selected a few tools to use in this program.

# Graph Analysis
In this project, we used one of the most powerful libraries for graph analysis. Using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), we generated many indicators to check a citation graph. Some materials in this regard are given [here](docs/graph-analysis.md). You can use other libraries as well.


# Knowledge Extraction
In the architecture of this software, the structure of the article is stored in the database and this structure also contains the summary of the article. For this reason, it is possible to perform NLP processes such as keywords extraction, topic extraction etc., which can be completed in the future[.](docs/knowledge-extraction.md)


# Related Article
This topic is very interesting from a research point of view, so I have included the articles that were interesting [here](docs/article.md).



# Code Quality
We used flake8 and black libraries to increase code quality.
More information can be found [here](docs/code-quality.md).
