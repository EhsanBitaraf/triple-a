                            "AbstractText" : "Breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are among the most common cancers in Iran. We aimed to develop a risk assessment model to predict the development of cardiovascular events in these patients by performing a 5 year prospective cohort study on a newly diagnosed patients with BC or CRC before they receive any treatment. A multi-center prospective cohort study of 2700 newly diagnosed BC and CRC patients has been started in Iran since 2019 and will be continued until 2024. Demographics, socioeconomic status, life style behaviors, psychological characteristics and type of cancer treatments will be collected by standard questionnaires and blood pressure, obesity indices will be measured. Blood sampling, ECG, and echocardiography will be done in all patients at base line, 6 and 12 months, then at annual basis for five years. Incidence of heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and CVD related death are the primary outcome of this study. In this preliminary analysis, 70 patients with BC and 30 patients with CRC were enrolled in this study from April 2019 to November 2019. Mean age of BC and CRC patients was 48 ± 10.5 and 61 ± 13.2 respectively. 98.6% of patients in BC group and 60% of CRC groups were female. This study will be a platform for other cancers to develop CVD risk assessment charts that can cover other cancers. Patients who lie in the high risk category according to the newly developed risk assessment chart, should receive special management and preventive interventions.",
