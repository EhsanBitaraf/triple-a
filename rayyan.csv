1,Scaling the Discrete-time Wright Fisher model to biobank-scale datasets.,"Jeffrey P Spence,Tony Zeng,Hakhamanesh Mostafavi,Jonathan K Pritchard",,,,,2023,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37293115/,"The Discrete-Time Wright Fisher (DTWF) model and its large population diffusion limit are central to population genetics. These models describe the forward-in-time evolution of the frequency of an allele in a population and can include the fundamental forces of genetic drift, mutation, and selection. Computing like-lihoods under the diffusion process is feasible, but the diffusion approximation breaks down for large sample sizes or in the presence of strong selection. Unfortunately, existing methods for computing likelihoods under the DTWF model do not scale to current exome sequencing sample sizes in the hundreds of thousands. Here we present an algorithm that approximates the DTWF model with provably bounded error and runs in time linear in the size of the population. Our approach relies on two key observations about Binomial distributions. The first is that Binomial distributions are approximately sparse. The second is that Binomial distributions with similar success probabilities are extremely close as distributions, allowing us to approximate the DTWF Markov transition matrix as a very low rank matrix. Together, these observations enable matrix-vector multiplication in linear (as opposed to the usual quadratic) time. We prove similar properties for Hypergeometric distributions, enabling fast computation of likelihoods for subsamples of the population. We show theoretically and in practice that this approximation is highly accurate and can scale to population sizes in the billions, paving the way for rigorous biobank-scale population genetic inference. Finally, we use our results to estimate how increasing sample sizes will improve the estimation of selection coefficients acting on loss-of-function variants. We find that increasing sample sizes beyond existing large exome sequencing cohorts will provide essentially no additional information except for genes with the most extreme fitness effects.",,,
2,Drivers and constraints to environmental sustainability in UK-based biobanking: balancing resource efficiency and future value.,"Gabrielle Samuel,Jessica M Sims",,,,,2023,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37264320/," Biobanks are a key aspect of healthcare research; they enable access to a wide range of heterogenous samples and data, as well as saving individual researchers time and funds on the collection, storage and/or curation of such resources. However, biobanks are also associated with impacts associated with a depletion of natural resources (energy, water etc.) production of toxic chemicals during manufacturing of laboratory equipment, and effects on biodiversity. We wanted to better understand the biobanking sector in the UK as a first step to assessing the environmental impacts of UK biobanking. We explored the sample storage infrastructure and environmental sustainability practices at a number of UK biobanks through a mixed methods quantitative and qualitative approach, including information gathering on an online platform, and eight in-depth interviews. Environmental sustainability was deprioritised behind biobanks' financial sustainability practices. Nevertheless, both often aligned in practice. However, there was a tendency towards underutilisation of stored samples, the avoidance of centralisation, and providing accessibility to biosamples, and this conflicted with valuing sustainability goals. This related to notions of individualised and competitive biobanking culture. Furthermore, the study raised how value attachments to biosamples overshadows needs for both financial and environmental sustainability concerns. We need to move away from individualised and competitive biobanking cultures towards a realisation that the health of the publics and patients should be first and foremost. We need to ensure the use of biosamples, ahead of their storage ('smart attachments'), align with environmental sustainability goals and participants' donation wishes for biosample use.",,,Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Health Services Research;Research Personnel;United Kingdom;Biobank;Biobanking;Bioresource;Biosamples;Environmental impacts;Ethics;Health;Sustainability;Value;Values;
3,"Associations of diabetes, prediabetes and diabetes duration with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A prospective UK Biobank study.","Jian Su,Mengyao Li,Xinglin Wan,Hao Yu,Yanan Wan,Dong Hang,Yan Lu,Ran Tao,Ming Wu,Jinyi Zhou,Xikang Fan",,,,,2023,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37248816/," To investigate the associations of diabetes, prediabetes and diabetes duration with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk and survival in the UK Biobank. We conducted a prospective analysis among 452 680 participants without COPD at baseline using UK Biobank data. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox regression models. The dose-response relationship was explored using restricted cubic splines. A separate survival analysis was conducted for 12 595 patients with incident COPD. Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 12 595 cases of COPD were documented. Compared with the reference group, those with prediabetes and diabetes were associated with an 18% (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 1.13-1.24]) and 35% (HR 1.35 [95% CI: 1.24-1.47]) higher risk of COPD, respectively. Diabetes duration was associated with COPD risk, with multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of 1.23 (1.05-1.44), 1.20 (1.04-1.39) and 1.18 (1.01-1.37) for diabetes duration of 7 years or longer, 3 to less than 7 years, and 1 to less than 3 years versus less than 1 year, respectively. Dose-response analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between diabetes duration and COPD risk. Regarding COPD survival, COPD patients with prediabetes and diabetes had a 9% (HR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.00-1.19]) and 21% (HR 1.21 [95% CI: 1.05-1.41]) higher risk of overall death, respectively. Compared with the cases with a diabetes duration of less than 1 year, those with a diabetes duration of 7 years or longer were associated with a 46% higher risk of overall death (HR 1.46 [95% CI: 1.11-1.92]). Our findings indicate that diabetes, prediabetes and a longer diabetes duration are associated with a higher risk of and worse survival for COPD. Future studies are warranted to determine the optimal way of diabetes control that might reduce COPD risk.",,,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;diabetes;diabetes duration;prediabetes;prospective cohort study;

To better understand this link, we performed a two-stage genome-wide by environment interaction studies (GWEIS) of MS and offspring education score in UK Biobank cohort. Specifically, 276 996 subjects from England were enrolled in the discovery study, while 24 355 subjects from Scotland and 14 526 subjects from Wales were enrolled in the replication study. GWEIS were conducted by PLINK 2.0 with MS used as an environmental risk factor. Significant GWEIS associations (P < 0.0001) between MS and offspring education score in both the discovery cohort and two replicate cohorts (Scotland population and Wales population) were identified. GWEIS identified 2 independent significant single nucleotide polymorphism-MS interaction, with one variant located in the chromosomal 16 (rs72768988, Position: 22,768,798, P = 1.22 × 10-8, β = 6.7662) and the other one located in 2q32.3 region (2 : 196424612_GT_G, Position: 196 424 612, 3.60 × 10-9, β = -0.4721).

6,Systematic analyses of GWAS summary statistics from UK Biobank identified novel susceptibility loci and genes for upper gastrointestinal diseases.,"Renfang Han,Junxiang Huang,Nimei Zeng,Fangfei Xie,Yi Wang,Yun Wang,Jingyi Fan",,,,,2023,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37198407/,"In recent decades, upper gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have been highly prevalent worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of susceptibility loci, only a few of them were conducted for chronic upper GI disorders, and most of them were underpowered and with small sample sizes. Additionally, for the known loci, only a tiny fraction of heritability can be explained and the underlying mechanisms and related genes remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a multi-trait analysis by the MTAG software and a two-stage transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with UTMOST and FUSION for seven upper GI diseases (oesophagitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, other diseases of oesophagus, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis and other diseases of stomach and duodenum) based on summary GWAS statistics from UK Biobank. In the MTAG analysis, we identified 7 loci associated with these upper GI diseases, including 3 novel ones at 4p12 (rs10029980), 12q13.13 (rs4759317) and 18p11.32 (rs4797954). In the TWAS analysis, we revealed 5 susceptibility genes in known loci and identified 12 novel potential susceptibility genes, including HOXC9 at 12q13.13. Further functional annotations and colocalization analysis indicated that rs4759317 (A>G) driven the association for GWAS signals and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) simultaneously at 12q13.13. The identified variant acted by decreasing the expression of HOXC9 to affect the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This study provided insights into the genetic nature of upper GI diseases.",,,

Research on knowledge and attitudes of Danish parents on the usage of their children's biological material is scarce. A coproduced study between a mother and 2 researchers. We analyzed 5 online focus group interviews using Ricoeur's hermeneutical narrative analysis. Mothers have very little knowledge on the storage and usage of their children's biological material. They consider the Phenylketonuria-screening test to be part of a birth package, which leaves very little option of choice. They accept donating the material as a token of appreciation in an act of altruism toward the wider society but are only comfortable supporting Danish research. An exploration of the communal narrative build in the interviews reveal an overall feeling of duty to help benefit society, an overwhelming trust toward the health system, and epistemic unjust storage information practices.",,,biobaking policy;coproduction;focus group interviews;narrative analysis;patient perspectives;

The International Standards Organization's (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) on Biotechnology, working with extensive input from the International Society for Cells and Gene Therapy (ISCT), has recently published ISO standardization documents that are focused on biobanking of MSCs from two tissue sources, Wharton's Jelly, MSC(WJ) and Bone Marrow, MSC(M)), for research and development purposes and development. This manuscript explains the path towards the consensus on the following two documents: the Technical Standard ISO/TS 22859 for MSC(WJ) and the full ISO Standard 24651 for MSC(M) biobanking. The ISO standardization documents are aligned with ISCT's MSC committee position and recommendations on nomenclature because there was active input and incorporation of ISCT MSC committee recommendations in the development of these standards. The ISO standardization documents contain both requirements and recommendations for functional characterization of MSC(WJ) and MSC(M) using a matrix of assays. Importantly, the ISO standardization documents have a carefully defined scope and are meant for research use of culture expanded MSC(WJ) and MSC(M). The ISO standardization documents can be updated in a revision process and will be systematically reviewed after 3-5 years as scientific insights grow. They represent international consensus on MSC identity, definition, and characterization; are rigorous in detailing multivariate characterization of MSCs and represent an evolving-but-important first step in standardization of MSC biobanking and characterization for research use and development.",,,MSC;Wharton's Jelly;biobanking;bone marrow;culture-expanded MSCs;functional characterization;nomenclature;standards;

To evaluate the impact of selective participation, here we derived UK Biobank participation probabilities on the basis of 14 variables harmonized across the UK Biobank and a representative sample. We then conducted weighted genome-wide association analyses on 19 traits. Comparing the output from weighted genome-wide association analyses (n = 94,643 to 102,215) with that from standard genome-wide association analyses (n = 263,464 to 283,749), we found that increasing representativeness led to changes in SNP effect sizes and identified novel SNP associations for 12 traits. While heritability estimates were less impacted by weighting (maximum change in h, 5%), we found substantial discrepancies for genetic correlations (maximum change in r, 0.31) and Mendelian randomization estimates (maximum change in β, 0.15) for socio-behavioural traits. We urge the field to increase representativeness in biobank samples, especially when studying genetic correlates of behaviour, lifestyles and social outcomes.",,,

We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in 336,975 unrelated white-British UK Biobank participants. Self-reported insomnia symptoms were instrumented by a genetic risk score (GRS) created from 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of 11,409 outcomes from UK Biobank were extracted and processed by an automated pipeline (PHESANT) for the MR-PheWAS. Potential causal effects (those passing a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold) were followed up with two-sample MR in MR-Base, where possible. Four hundred thirty-seven potential causal effects of insomnia symptoms were observed for a diverse range of outcomes, including anxiety, depression, pain, body composition, respiratory, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular traits. We were able to undertake two-sample MR for 71 of these 437 and found evidence of causal effects (with directionally concordant effect estimates across main and sensitivity analyses) for 30 of these. These included novel findings (by which we mean not extensively explored in conventional observational studies and not previously explored using MR based on a systematic search) of an adverse effect on risk of spondylosis (OR [95%CI] = 1.55 [1.33, 1.81]) and bronchitis (OR [95%CI] = 1.12 [1.03, 1.22]), among others. Insomnia symptoms potentially cause a wide range of adverse health-related outcomes and behaviours.

Here we present an automated phenotyping pipeline for obtaining skeletal measurements from DXA scans and compare its performance to manually collected measurements. A pipeline that extends the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) framework was developed on 341 whole-body DXA scans of UK Biobank South Asian participants. A set of 10 measurements throughout the skeleton was automatically obtained via this process, and the performance of the method was tested on 20 additional DXA images by calculating percent error and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) for manual and automated measurements. Stature was then regressed on the automated femoral and tibia lengths and compared to published stature regressions to further assess the reliability of the automated measurements. Based on percent error and CCC, the performance of the automated measurements falls into three categories: poor (sacral and acetabular breadths), variable (trunk length, upper thoracic breadth, and innominate height), and high (maximum pelvic aperture breadth, bi-iliac breadth, femoral maximum length, and tibia length). Stature regression plots indicate that the automated measurements reflect realistic body proportions and appear consistent with published data reflecting these relationships in South Asian populations. Based on the performance of this pipeline, a subset of measurements can be reliably extracted from DXA scans, greatly expanding the utility of biobank-level data for biological anthropologists and medical researchers.",,,DXA;South Asia;UK Biobank;automated phenotyping;skeletal metrics;

We developed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions and attitudes regarding genetic research of researchers from Egypt, Sudan, Morocco, and Jordan. The questionnaire requested demographic data, perceptions, and attitudes regarding the collection, storage, and use of biospecimens and data, the use of broad consent, data security, data sharing, and community engagement. We used multiple linear regressions to identify predictors of perceptions and attitudes.  We recruited 383 researchers. Researchers favored equally the use of broad and tiered consent (44.1% and 39.1%, respectively).

We compared the accuracy and runtime performance of Rye to the widely used RFMix, ADMIXTURE and iAdmix programs and applied it to a dataset of 488221 genome-wide variant samples from the UK Biobank. Rye infers GA based on principal component analysis of genomic variant samples from ancestral reference populations and query individuals. The algorithm's accuracy is powered by Metropolis-Hastings optimization and its speed is provided by non-negative least squares regression. Rye produces highly accurate GA estimates for three-way admixed populations-African, European and Native American-compared to RFMix and ADMIXTURE (${R}^2 = \ 0.998 - 1.00$), and shows 50× runtime improvement compared to ADMIXTURE on the UK Biobank dataset.

We conducted a prospective cohort study on people with BD or MDD in the UK from 2006 to 2010 using UK Biobank touchscreen questionnaire data and linked administrative health databases. The association between SRH and 2-year all-cause hospitalizations was assessed using proportional hazard regression after adjustment for sociodemographics, lifestyle behaviors, previous hospitalization use, the Elixhauser comorbidity index, and environmental factors. A total of 29,966 participants were identified, experiencing 10,279 hospitalization events. Among the cohort, the average age was 55.88 (SD 8.01) years, 64.02 % were female, and 3029 (10.11 %), 15,972 (53.30 %), 8313 (27.74 %), and 2652 (8.85 %) reported excellent, good, fair, and poor SRH, respectively. Among patients reporting poor SRH, 54.19 % had a hospitalization event within 2 years compared with 22.65 % for those having excellent SRH. In the adjusted analysis, patients with good, fair, and poor SRH had 1.31 (95 % CI 1.21-1.42), 1.82 (95 % CI 1.68-1.98), and 2.45 (95 % CI 2.22, 2.70) higher hazards of hospitalization, respectively, than those with excellent SRH. Selection bias can exist as our cohort cannot fully represent all the BD and MDD cases in the UK. Moreover, the causality is questionable.

We investigated circulating levels of amino acids in relation to colorectal cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and UK Biobank cohorts. Concentrations of 13-21 amino acids were determined in baseline fasting plasma or serum samples in 654 incident colorectal cancer cases and 654 matched controls in EPIC. Amino acids associated with colorectal cancer risk following adjustment for the false discovery rate (FDR) were then tested for associations in the UK Biobank, for which measurements of 9 amino acids were available in 111,323 participants, of which 1221 were incident colorectal cancer cases. Histidine levels were inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in EPIC (odds ratio [OR] 0.80 per standard deviation [SD], 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.92, FDR P-value=0.03) and in UK Biobank (HR 0.93 per SD, 95% CI 0.87-0.99, P-value=0.03).

Denmark (population ~5.9 million) provides a unique setting for population-based health research. The country is a rich source of biobanks and the universal, tax-funded healthcare system delivers routinely collected data to numerous registries and databases. By virtue of the civil registration number (assigned uniquely to all Danish citizens), biological specimens stored in biobanks can be combined with clinical and demographic data from these population-based health registries and databases. In this review, we aim to provide an understanding of advantages and possibilities of biobank research in Denmark. As knowledge about the Danish setting is needed to grasp the full potential, we first introduce the Danish healthcare system, the Civil Registration System, the population-based registries, and the interface with biobanks. We then describe the biobank infrastructures, comprising the Danish National Biobank Initiative, the Bio- and Genome Bank Denmark, and the Danish National Genome Center.

In 2019, Shams-White and colleagues created the  2018 WCRF/AICR Score  which aimed to standardise how adherence to these recommendations is assessed. The standardised scoring system includes seven of the recommendations concerning weight, physical activity and diet, with an optional eighth recommendation on breastfeeding. To promote transparency and reproducibility, the present paper describes the methodology for operationalisation of the standardised scoring system in the UK Biobank. UK Biobank recruited >500,000 individuals aged 37-73 years, between 2006 and 2010. In 2021, we held a workshop with experts which aimed to reach consensus on how to operationalise the scoring system using data available within UK Biobank. We used data on anthropometric measurements, physical activity and diet to calculate adherence scores. 24 h dietary assessment data were used to measure adherence to the following recommendations:  Eat a diet rich in wholegrains, vegetables, fruit, and beans ,  Limit consumption of  fast foods  and other processed foods high in fat, starches or sugars  and  Limit consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks ; food frequency questionnaire data were used to assess adherence to  Limit consumption of red and processed meat  and  Limit alcohol consumption . Participants were allocated points for meeting, partially meeting or not meeting each recommendation, using cut-offs defined in the standardised scoring system. At our workshop, discussions included the use of national guidelines to assess adherence to the recommendation on alcohol consumption, as well as challenges faced including defining the adapted ultra-processed food variables. A total score was calculated for 158,415 participants (mean 3.9 points, range 0-7 points).

As the sole blood service in Québec (Canada), Héma-Québec established a COVID-19-focused biobank ('PlasCoV') in April 2021. As of January 2022, the biobank included 86 483 plasma samples from 15 502 regular donors (age range=18-84 years, females=49.7%), for an average of 5.6 donations per donor. Nearly two-thirds (65.6%) of biobank donors made at least two donations, with many donors having provided samples prevaccination and postvaccination (3061 (19.7%)) or preinfection and postinfection (131 (0.8%)), thus allowing for longitudinal studies on vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity. A study that used PlasCoV samples revealed that previously infected individuals who received a single dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine exhibited the strongest immune response. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals required two vaccine doses to produce a maximal immune response. Furthermore, the results of a four-phase seroprevalence study indicated that the antinucleocapsid (N) response wanes rapidly, so that up to one-third of previously infected donors were seronegative for anti-N. Donations from individuals who consented to participate before 1 October 2022 will be collected up until 31 March 2023. This plasma biobank will facilitate the conduct of longitudinal studies on COVID-19 immunity, thus helping to provide valuable insights into the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response and its persistence, and the effects of vaccination and variants on the specificity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response.",,,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Humans;Middle Aged;Young Adult;Antibodies, Viral;Biological Specimen Banks;Blood Donors;BNT162 Vaccine;COVID-19;COVID-19 Vaccines;Quebec;SARS-CoV-2;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Vaccination;Male;Blood bank & transfusion medicine;COVID-19;Public health"

Given the diverse nature of this data, researchers use different approaches - from the use of a single test to composing the general intelligence score, , across the tests. We argue that both approaches are suboptimal - one being too specific and the other one too general - and suggest a novel multifactorial solution to represent cognitive abilities. Using a combined Exploratory Factor (EFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling Analyses (ESEM) we developed a three-factor model to characterize an underlying structure of nine cognitive tests selected from the UK Biobank using a Cattell-Horn-Carroll framework. We first estimated a series of probable factor solutions using the maximum likelihood method of extraction. The best solution for the EFA-defined factor structure was then tested using the ESEM approach with the aim of confirming or disconfirming the decisions made. We determined that a three-factor model fits the UK Biobank cognitive assessment data best. Two of the three factors can be assigned to  with a clear distinction between  and . The third factor was identified as a  factor.

Although several studies have assessed the association of UPFs with kidney function decline or CKD in various countries, no evidence has been shown in China and the United Kingdom. This study aims to evaluate the association between UPF consumption and risk of CKD in 2 large cohort studies from China and the United Kingdom. In total, 23,775 and 102,332 participants without baseline CKD were enrolled in the Tianjin Chronic Low-Grade Systemic Inflammation and Health (TCLSIH) and UK Biobank cohort studies, respectively. Information on UPF consumption was obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire in the TCLSIH and 24-h dietary recalls in the UK Biobank cohort. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m, albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g, or as having a clinical diagnosis of CKD in both cohorts. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between UPF consumption and the risk of CKD. After a median follow-up of 4.0 and 10.1 y, the incidence rates of CKD were around 1.1% and 1.7% in the TCLSIH and UK Biobank cohorts, respectively. The multivariable hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of CKD across increasing quartiles (quartiles 1-4) of UPF consumption were 1 (reference), 1.24 (0.89, 1.72), 1.30 (0.91, 1.87), and 1.58 (1.07, 2.34) (P for trend = 0.02) in the TCLSIH cohort and 1 (reference), 1.14 (1.00, 1.31), 1.16 (1.01, 1.33), and 1.25 (1.09, 1.43) (P for trend < 0.01) in the UK Biobank cohort, respectively. Our finding indicated that higher UPF consumption is associated with a higher risk of CKD. Moreover, restricting UPF consumption may potentially benefit the prevention of CKD.

We aimed to address this by using a rigorously constructed conceptual causal model to guide an empirical analysis estimating the effect of PA on CF in the UK Biobank cohort of middle-aged and older adults. This study analysed a subsample of 334 227 adults from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. PA was measured subjectively by self-report and by device using accelerometry, and CF was measured using objective cognitive tests. Composite CF measures were derived to represent general and domain-specific performance. Effect coefficients were estimated using regression models, adjusting for a wide range of confounders specified by the assumed causal model, including genetic risk factors, and relevant health, sociodemographic and behavioural variables from across the lifespan. Results indicated very small effect sizes (standardized mean difference estimates all <0.01) of inconsistent direction, for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The expected protective effect of PA on CF was not observed.

A total of 417 504 participants free of prior kidney diseases were included from UK Biobank. Handgrip strength was assessed by dynamometer. The walking pace was self-reported as slow, average, or brisk. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident CKD. The average age of the study population was 56.3 (SD, 8.1) years. 192 012 (46.0%) of the participants were male. The mean handgrip strength was 23.5 (SD, 6.2) and 40.0 (SD, 8.8) kg for females and males, respectively. Over a median follow-up duration of 12.1 years, 11 064 (2.7%) participants developed incident CKD. Handgrip strength was significantly inversely associated with the risk of incident CKD in both males and females (both P for trend <0.001). When handgrip strength was assessed as sex-specific quartiles, compared with those in the first quartile, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) of incident CKD in participants in the second, third and fourth quartiles were 0.84 (0.79, 0.89), 0.76 (0.71, 0.81) and 0.72 (0.67, 0.77), respectively. Compared with those with slow walking pace, participants with average (HR, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.60-0.68) or brisk (HR, 0.53; 95% CI: 0.49-0.57) walking pace had significantly lower risks of incident CKD. Compared with those with both lower handgrip strength (the first quartile) and slow walking pace, the lowest risk of incident CKD was observed in participants with both higher handgrip strength (the 2-4 quartiles) and average or brisk walking pace (HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.46-0.55).

Using the iPSYCH dataset, comprising 130,438 individuals, genotyped in two stages, on different arrays, we evaluated phasing and imputation performance across multiple phasing methods and data integration protocols. While phasing accuracy varied by choice of method and data integration protocol, imputation accuracy varied mostly between data integration protocols. We demonstrate an attenuation in imputation accuracy within samples of non-European origin, highlighting challenges to studying complex traits in diverse populations. Finally, imputation errors can bias association tests, reduce predictive utility of polygenic scores.

37,Pediatric biobanks to enhance clinical and translational research for children.,"Alessandra Cianflone,Fabio Savoia,Rosanna Parasole,Peppino Mirabelli",,,,,2023,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36692622/,"Including children in biomedical research is an argument for continual reflection and practice refinement from an ethical and legal standpoint. Indeed, as children reach adulthood, a reconsent method should be used, and data connected with samples should ideally be updated based on the children's growth and long-term results. Furthermore, because most pediatric disorders are uncommon, children's research initiatives should conform to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by worldwide scientific organizations for successfully sharing data and samples. Here, we examine how pediatric biobanks can help address some challenges to improve biomedical research for children. Indeed, modern biobanks are evolving as complex research platforms with specialized employees, dedicated spaces, information technologies services (ITS), and ethical and legal expertise. In the case of research for children, biobanks can collaborate with scientific networks (i.e., BBMRI-ERIC) and provide the collection, storage, and distribution of biosamples in agreement with international standard procedures (ISO-20387). Close collaboration among biobanks provides shared avenues for maximizing scarce biological samples, which is required to promote the translation of scientific breakthroughs for developing clinical care and health policies tailored to the pediatric population. Moreover, biobanks, through their science communication and dissemination activities (i.e., European Biobank Week), may be helpful for children to understand what it means to be engaged in a research study, allowing them to see it as a pleasant, useful, and empowering experience. Additionally, biobanks can notify each participant about which projects have been accomplished (i.e., through their websites, social media networks, etc.); they can facilitate future reconsent procedures and update sample-associated data based on the children's growth. Finally, because of the increasing interest from public and commercial organizations in research efforts that include the sharing and reuse of health data, pediatric biobanks have a crucial role in this context. Consequently, they could benefit from funding opportunities for sustaining research activities even regarding rare pediatric disorders.  Conclusion: Pediatric biobanks are helpful for providing biological material for research purposes, addressing ethical and legal issues (i.e. data protection, consent, etc.), and providing control samples from healthy children of various ages and from different geographical regions and ethnicities. Therefore, it is vital to encourage and maintain children's engagement in medical research programs and biobanking activities, especially as children become adults, and reconsent procedures must be applied. What is Known: • Biobanks are critical research infrastructures for medical research, especially in the era of  omic  science. However, in light of their fragility and rights children's participation in biobanking and medical research programs is a complex argument of continuous debate in scientific literature. What is New: • We propose a review of the literature on pediatric biobanks with a particular focus on oncological biobanks. The main current limitations and challenges for pediatric biobanks are presented and possible solutions are discussed.",,,"Child;Humans;Adult;Translational Research, Biomedical;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Computer Security;Rare Diseases;Biobank;Children;Consent;Pediatrics;Rare disease;Rare tumors;Reconsent"

Correlation with biomarkers is often used to assess the relative validity of these different approaches, however, validated biomarkers do not always exist and are costly and laborious to collect. We present a novel high-throughput approach which utilizes the modest but importantly non-zero influence of genetic variation on variation in dietary intake to compare different statistical transformations of dietary variables. Specifically, we compare the heritability of crude averages with Empirical Bayes weighted averages for 302 correlated dietary variables from multiple 24-hour recall questionnaires in 177 K individuals in UK Biobank. Overall, the crude averages for frequency of consumption are more heritable than their Empirical Bayes counterparts only when the reliability of that item across questionnaires is high (measured by intra-class correlation), otherwise, the Empirical Bayes approach (for both unreliably measured frequencies and for average quantities independent of reliability) leads to higher heritability estimates. We also find that the more heritable versions of each dietary variable lead to stronger underlying statistical associations with specific genetic loci, many of which have well-known mechanisms, further supporting heritability as an alternative metric for relative validity in nutritional epidemiology and beyond.",,,24-hour diet recall questionnaires;empirical bayes;heritability;longitudinal data;nutrigenomics;nutritional epidemiology;phenotyping;relative validity;

A representative sample of 600 Slovaks completed Slider Measure to assess their social value orientation. Thereafter, they reported their level of awareness of biobanks and their willingness to provide biospecimens and personal information to biobanks. The results showed a positive relationship between awareness and willingness. Although social value orientation was not the moderator, we found that this relationship was significant only in the groups of altruists and individualists. The results remained robust after taking sociodemographic and institutional trust factors into account.

From UK Biobank, individuals with cardiometabolic multimorbidity , defined as the coincidence of at least 2 cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and stroke) were included in this study. Four low-risk sleep factors, including early chronotype, sleep 7-8 h/d, free of insomnia, and no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness, were used to generate a healthy sleep score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants with a score of 0-1, 2, 3-4 were clustered into groups with poor, intermediate, and healthy sleep pattern, respectively. We assessed the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality using the Cox proportional hazards model. Among included 35,757 participants, the mean age (standard deviation)) was 61.82 (6.3) years. After full adjustment, early chronotype, sleep 7-8 h/d, no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness, and free of insomnia were independently associated with 8%, 12%, 11%, and 8% lower risk of all-cause mortality among all persons with cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We found the fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality was 0.90 (0.88-0.92) for a 1-point increase in the healthy sleep score. Compared with the reference group, participants with the intermediate and healthy sleep pattern had 9% and 23% lower risk of all-cause death, respectively, in the fully adjusted model. A healthy sleep pattern combining 4 low-risk sleep factors could be regarded as a healthy lifestyle for individuals with cardiometabolic multimorbidity to lower the risk of all-cause mortality.

An attractive strategy is to run these programs on a set of ancestry-informative SNP markers (AIMs) that exhibit substantially different frequencies across populations. Unfortunately, existing methods for identifying AIMs require knowing ancestry labels for a subset of the sample. This supervised learning approach creates a chicken and the egg scenario.

This study investigates the relationship among obesity-related polygenic risk score (PRS), obesity phenotypes and the risk of having asthma. This is a matched case-control study, with 4 controls (8288 non-asthmatic) for each case (2072 asthmatic). Data were obtained from the 2008-2015 Taiwan Biobank Database and linked to the 2000-2016 National Health Insurance Research Database. All participants were ≥30 years old with no history of cancer and had a complete questionnaire, as well as physical examination, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical diagnosis data. Environmental exposure, PM, was also considered. Multivariate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional logistic regression stratified by age and sex. Mediation analysis was also assessed, using a generalised linear model. We found that the obese phenotype was associated with significantly increased odds of asthma by approximately 26%. Four obesity-related PRS, including body mass index (OR=1.07 (1.01-1.13)), waist circumference (OR=1.10 (1.04-1.17)), central obesity as defined by waist-to-height ratio (OR=1.09 (1.03-1.15)) and general-central obesity (OR=1.06 (1.00-1.12)), were associated with increased odds of asthma. Additional independent risk factors for asthma included lower educational level, family history of asthma, certain chronic diseases and increased PM exposure. Obesity-related PRS is an indirect risk factor for asthma, the link being fully mediated by the trait of obesity. Obese phenotypes and obesity-related PRS are independent risk factors for having asthma in adults in the Taiwan Biobank.

Specifically, we determine disease associations by accounting for the direction of effects of genetic components shared between diseases, and categorize those associations as synergistic or antagonistic. We further develop a comorbidity scoring algorithm to predict whether diseases are more or less likely to co-occur in the presence of a given index disease. This algorithm can handle networks that incorporate relationships with opposite signs.

We also compared the sex differences using an established formula. After accounting for multiple testing with false discovery rate < 5% and controlling for confounders, the positive associations of unprocessed red meat consumption with branched-chain amino acids and several lipoproteins, and the inverse association with glycine were stronger in women, while the positive associations with apolipoprotein A1, creatinine, and monounsaturated fatty acids were more obvious in men. For processed meat, the positive associations with branched-chain amino acids, several lipoproteins, tyrosine, lactate, glycoprotein acetyls and inverse associations with glutamine, and glycine were stronger in women than in men.

Smoking, non-HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, HbA1c, physical activity, diet, and sleep were used to create a modified version of the LE8 score. Associations between the score (both as a continuous score and as quartiles) and outcomes were investigated using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. The potential impact fractions of two scenarios were also calculated. Over a median follow-up of 10.4 years, there were 25,068 MACE. Compared to individuals in the highest quartile of the score (healthiest), those in the lowest quartile (least healthy) had 2.07 (95% CI: 1.99; 2.16) higher risk for MACE. The highest relative risk gradient of the individual outcomes was observed for HF (HR: 2.67 [95% CI: 2.42; 2.94]).

Public involvement in biobanks, necessary for their development, is limited due to inadequate knowledge of biobanking and concerns about sample donation. This study explores the effectiveness of different publicity methods in improving participants' willingness to donate, and assesses public motivations and concerns. It aims to identify an efficient method of improving participants' awareness of biobanking and promoting sample donation. A structured 20-item questionnaire was formulated to evaluate participants' knowledge of and attitudes toward biobanks and sample donation. In total, 1,500 questionnaires were disseminated to three groups of 500 participants who received, respectively, picture-based promotional material, text-based promotional material, or who attended a biobank-related lecture. Of these, 945 completed questionnaires were received. All the participants completed the questionnaires twice, before and after the corresponding publicity education. After each of the three methods of publicity based on text, pictures and a lecture, respondents' willingness to donate samples was significantly increased ( < 0.001), the lecture being more effective than the other two methods ( = 0.001). Participants with a medical background were more willing to donate biospecimens after publicity than those without medical backgrounds ( < 0.005) but had common motivations for donation including altruism and aiding medical research. The main concern hindering respondents' willingness to donate was the security of personal information. Different types of biobank-related publicity based on text material, pictorial material and a lecture all improved respondents' willingness to donate and reduced concerns regarding sample donation. Medical background was a critical factor affecting attitudes toward sample donation after publicity. The results of this study suggest strategies that may popularize biobanks and enhance sample donation, further promoting the development of biobanks.",,,Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;East Asian People;Asian People;Motivation;Biomedical Research;attitude;biobank;concern;motivation;publicity;sample donation;

Despite its growing importance underpinned by the European in vitro diagnostics regulation or broad preanalytical programs by the National Institutes of Health, little is known about its empirical occurrence in biobanked surgical specimen. In several steps, the Tissue Bank Bern achieved a fully informative SPREC code with insights from 10,555 CIT, 4,740 WIT, and 3,121 FIT values. During process optimization according to LEAN six sigma principles, we identified a dual role of the SPREC code as a sample characteristic and a traceable process parameter. With this preanalytical study, we outlined real-life data in a variety of organs with specific differences in WIT, CIT, and FIT values. Furthermore, our FIT data indicate the potential to adapt the SPREC fixation toward concrete paraffin-embedding time points and to extend its categories beyond 72 h due to weekend delays. Additionally, we identified dependencies of preanalytical variables from workload, daytime, and clinics that were actionable with LEAN process management. Thus, streamlined biobanking workflows during the day were significantly resilient to workload peaks, diminishing the turnaround times of native tissue processing (i.e. CIT) from 74.6 to 46.1 min under heavily stressed conditions. In conclusion, there are surgery-specific preanalytics that are surgico-pathologically limited even under process optimization, which might affect biomarker transfer from one entity to another. Beyond sample characteristics, SPREC coding is highly beneficial for tissue banks and Institutes of Pathology to track WIT, CIT, and FIT for process optimization and monitoring measurements.",,,United States;Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;Cold Ischemia;LEAN;SPREC;biobanking;cold ischemia time;fixation time;warm ischemia time;

We aimed to explore the factors associated with the willingness of the public to participate in biobank research from four low- and middle-income countries in the Arab region (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Sudan). We used a previously validated questionnaire to assess several constructs that included the public's perceptions, attitudes, and willingness to participate in biobank research. We recruited 967 participants. More than half did not have prior awareness of biobanks. Participants' willingness to donate biospecimens and health data was less than 10%. Our results also showed that participants harbored concerns with trust, privacy, and with data-sharing involving international researchers. Predictors of willingness to participate in biobank research included no previous involvement in research and positive attitudes toward biobanks. Finally, our study showed several differences between the four countries regarding several of the investigated constructs. We conclude there should be additional efforts to raise public awareness and enhance perceptions of the public in biobanking research to enhance trust. We further recommend qualitative research to explore the underlying factors that contribute to the public's concerns with international data sharing that would enhance global health.",,,Humans;Arabs;Biological Specimen Banks;Developing Countries;Income;Trust;Arab countries;Attitudes;Biobanks;Data sharing;Genomic research;Perceptions;Privacy;Public;Return of individual research results;Trust;

For the majority of patients, the 5-year overall survival rate of less than 50% has hardly improved over the last decades. To improve the outcome of patients with all subtypes of ovarian cancer, large-scale fundamental and translational research is needed. To accommodate these types of ovarian cancer research, we have established a Dutch nationwide, interdisciplinary infrastructure and biobank: the Archipelago of Ovarian Cancer Research (AOCR). The AOCR will facilitate fundamental and translational ovarian cancer research and enhance interdisciplinary, national, and international collaboration. The AOCR biobank is a prospective ovarian cancer biobank in which biomaterials are collected, processed, and stored in a uniform matter for future (genetic) scientific research. All 19 Dutch hospitals in which ovarian cancer surgery is performed participate and collaborate in the AOCR biobank. Patients of 16 years and older with suspected or diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer are recruited for participation. Patients who agree to participate give written informed consent for collection, storage, and issue of their biomaterials for future studies. After inclusion, different blood samples are taken at various predefined time points both before and during treatment. In case of a diagnostic paracentesis or biopsy, the residual biomaterials of these procedures are stored in the biobank. During surgery, primary tumor tissue and, if applicable, tissue from metastatic sites are collected and stored. From each patient, a representative histological hematoxylin and eosin stained slide is digitalized for research purposes, including reassessment by a panel of gynecologic pathologists. Clinical and pathological data are obtained on a per-study basis from Dutch registries. Research proposals for the issue of biomaterials and data are evaluated by both the Archipelago Scientific Committee and the Steering Committee. Researchers using the biomaterials from the AOCR biobank are encouraged to enrich the biobank with data and materials resulting from their analyses and experiments. The implementation and first 4 years of collection are financed by an infrastructural grant from the Dutch Cancer Society. Therefore, the main limitation is that the costs for sustaining the biobank after the funding period will have to be covered. This coverage will come from incorporation of budget for biobanking in future grant applications and from fees from external researchers and commercial parties using the biomaterials stored in the AOCR biobank. Moreover, we will apply for grants aimed at sustaining and improving research infrastructures and biobanks. With the establishment of the Dutch nationwide, interdisciplinary Archipelago of Ovarian Cancer Research infrastructure and biobank, fundamental and translational research on ovarian cancer can be greatly improved. The ultimate aim of this infrastructure is that it will lead to improved diagnostics, treatment, and survival of patients with ovarian cancer.",,,"Humans;Female;Biological Specimen Banks;Translational Research, Biomedical;Prospective Studies;Ovarian Neoplasms;Biobank;Gynecologic cancer;Gynecologic pathology;Ovarian neoplasms;Research infrastructure"

The results showed that 65.0% of the participants were aware of the term  biobank  and knew what the activity of a biobank was, and 76.3% of subjects were willing to provide biospecimens to a research biobank, whereas 67.3% of the respondents were willing to contribute, in addition to biospecimens, their health and lifestyle data. Concerns were raised about the confidentiality of the information (25.6%) and the commercial use of the samples (25.0%). In conclusion, participants were aware of the role that biobanks play in research and were eager to participate for the sake of furthering scientific research. Still, several concerns need to be addressed regarding the confidentiality of the data along with the commercial use of the samples and associated data.",,,Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;Universities;Attitude;Public Opinion;Surveys and Questionnaires;Biomedical Research;biobanks;population;survey;

Frozen sections are to date the only way to examine the biobank material for its tumor content. We used ex vivo fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) to analyze biobank samples prior to cryoasservation. 127 punch biopsies were acquired from prostatectomy-specimens from 40 patients. These biopsies were analyzed with a Vivascope 2500-G4 prior to their transfer to the biobank. In difficult cases, larger samples of the prostatectomy specimens were FCM scanned in order to locate tumor foci. After patient acquisition, all samples were taken from the biobank and analyzed. We compared the results of the FCM examinations with the results of conventional histology and measured the DNA content. With upstream FCM, the tumor content of biobank samples could be determined with high confidence. The detection rate of representative biobank samples was increased due to the rapid feedback. The biobank samples were suitable for further molecular analysis. FCM allows for the first time lossless microscopic analysis of biobank samples prior to their cryoasservation and guarantees representative tumor and normal tissue for further molecular analysis.",,,"Male;Humans;Feasibility Studies;Biological Specimen Banks;Prostatic Neoplasms;Microscopy, Confocal;DNA;biobanking;cryoasservation;digital medicine;fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM);prostate cancer (PCa);targeted sampling"

This study investigated whether a healthy lifestyle is associated with lower CRC risk, regardless of genetic risk. We recruited 390,365 participants without cancer at baseline (2006-2010) from the UK Biobank. The primary outcome was CRC incidence. A healthy lifestyle score constructed using 16 factors of six dimensions (smoking, drinking, body mass index, diet, exercise, and sleep) was categorized into three risk categories: favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable. To calculate the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of UK Biobank participants, we extracted 454,678 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the UK Biobank and FinnGen Biobank after quality control. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the associations and was expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During a median follow-up of 10.90 years, 4,090 new CRC cases were reported in the UK Biobank. The  best-fit  PRSs were constructed using 59 SNPs based on the UK Biobank cohort and FinnGen genome-wide association study summary data (R = 0.23%) and were divided into low (lowest quintile), intermediate (including second-fourth quintile), and high (highest quintile) genetic risk categories. The multivariate-adjusted Cox model revealed that participants with favorable lifestyles had HRs of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.60-0.72) for developing CRC . those with unfavorable lifestyles; low genetic risk was associated with a decreased risk of CRC (HR = 0.67, 95% CI =0.61-0.74) compared with those with high genetic risk. The HRs for low genetic risk participants with favorable lifestyles were 0.44 (95% CI =0.36-0.55) . participants with high genetic risk and unfavorable lifestyles. Among the participants with low, intermediate, or high genetic risk, the HRs of favorable . unfavorable lifestyles were 0.74, 0.64, and 0.72 (all < 0.05). Low genetic risk and a favorable lifestyle were significantly associated with a decreased risk of CRC.

73,Liability-scale heritability estimation for biobank studies of low-prevalence disease.,"Sven E Ojavee,Zoltan Kutalik,Matthew R Robinson",,,,,2022,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36265482/,"Theory for liability-scale models of the underlying genetic basis of complex disease provides an important way to interpret, compare, and understand results generated from biological studies. In particular, through estimation of the liability-scale heritability (LSH), liability models facilitate an understanding and comparison of the relative importance of genetic and environmental risk factors that shape different clinically important disease outcomes. Increasingly, large-scale biobank studies that link genetic information to electronic health records, containing hundreds of disease diagnosis indicators that mostly occur infrequently within the sample, are becoming available. Here, we propose an extension of the existing liability-scale model theory suitable for estimating LSH in biobank studies of low-prevalence disease. In a simulation study, we find that our derived expression yields lower mean square error (MSE) and is less sensitive to prevalence misspecification as compared to previous transformations for diseases with ≤2% population prevalence and LSH of ≤0.45, especially if the biobank sample prevalence is less than that of the wider population. Applying our expression to 13 diagnostic outcomes of ≤3% prevalence in the UK Biobank study revealed important differences in LSH obtained from the different theoretical expressions that impact the conclusions made when comparing LSH across disease outcomes. This demonstrates the importance of careful consideration for estimation and prediction of low-prevalence disease outcomes and facilitates improved inference of the underlying genetic basis of ≤2% population prevalence diseases, especially where biobank sample ascertainment results in a healthier sample population.",,,Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;Prevalence;Causality;Computer Simulation;Genome-Wide Association Study;GWAS;biobanks;liability-scale heritability;

However, participation of children in biobanking has received only limited attention in the literature, even though research in general and in clinical trials in particular have a long history in involving minors. So, we resolved to explore specific challenging ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) in the current pediatric biobanking landscape to propose a way forward for biobanking with children as partners in research. Methodologically, we first established the accessibility and utilization of pediatric biobanks, mainly in Europe. This was supported by a literature review related to children's participation, taking into account not only academic papers but also relevant guidelines and best-practices. Our findings are discussed under five themes: general vulnerability; ethical issues-balancing risks and benefits, right to an open future, return of results including secondary findings; legal issues-capacity and legal majority; societal issues-public awareness and empowerment; and responsible research with children. Ultimately, we observed an on-going shift from the parents'/guardians' consent being a sine-qua-non condition to the positive minor's agreement: confirming that the minor is the participant, not the parent(s)/guardian(s). This ethical rethinking is paving the way toward age-appropriate, dynamic and participatory models of involving minors in decision-making. However, we identified a requirement for dynamic tools to assess maturity, a lack of co-produced engagement tools and paucity of shared best practices. We highlight the need to provide empowerment and capability settings to support researchers and biobankers, and back this with practical examples. In conclusion, equipping children and adults with appropriate tools, and ensuring children's participation is at the forefront of responsible pediatric biobanking, is an ethical obligation, and a cornerstone for research integrity.",,,"Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Child;Europe;Humans;Parents;Research Personnel;Translational Research, Biomedical;assent;children;empowerment;engagement;maturity;paediatric biobanking;vulnerability"

We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformedparticipant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations, and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source and transformed data. We identified 502 505 participants (3086 with COVID-19) and transformed 690 fields (1 373 239 555 rows) to the OMOP CDM using 8 different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke mappings. Specifically, we transformed self-reported noncancer illnesses 946 053 (83.91% of all source entries), cancers 37 802 (70.81%), medications 1 218 935 (88.25%), and prescriptions 864 788 (86.96%).

Because the number of diagnosed GD patients in Finland is relatively low, and the true prevalence is currently not known, it was hypothesized that undiagnosed GD patients may exist in Finland. Our previous study demonstrated the applicability of Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus point-scoring system (GED-C PSS; Mehta et al., 2019) and Finnish biobank data and specimens in the automated point scoring of large populations. An indicative point-score range for Finnish GD patients was determined, but undiagnosed patients were not identified partly due to high number of high-score subjects in combination with a lack of suitable samples for diagnostics in the assessed biobank population. The current study extended the screening to another biobank and evaluated the feasibility of utilising the automated GED-C PSS in conjunction with small nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip genotype data from the FinnGen study of biobank sample donors in the identification of undiagnosed GD patients in Finland. Furthermore, the applicability of FFPE tissues and DNA restoration in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the  gene were tested. Previously diagnosed Finnish GD patients eligible to the study, and up to 45,100 sample donors in Helsinki Biobank (HBB) were point scored. The GED-C point scoring, adjusted to local data, was automated, but also partly manually verified for GD patients. The SNP chip genotype data for rare  variants was visually assessed. FFPE tissues of GD patients were obtained from HBB and Biobank Borealis of Northern Finland (BB). Three previously diagnosed GD patients and one patient previously treated for GD-related features were included. A genetic diagnosis was confirmed for the patient treated for GD-related features. The GED-C point score of the GD patients was 12.5-22.5 in the current study. The score in eight Finnish GD patients of the previous and the current study is thus 6-22.5 points per patient. In the automated point scoring of the HBB subpopulation (N ≈ 45,100), the overall scores ranged from 0 to 17.5, with 0.77% (346/45,100) of the subjects having ≥10 points. The analysis of SNP chip genotype data was able to identify the diagnosed GD patients, but potential undiagnosed patients with the GED-C score and/or the  genotype indicative of GD were not discovered. Restoration of the FFPE tissue DNA improved the quality of the  NGS, and pathogenic  variants were confirmed in five out of six unrestored and in all four restored FFPE DNA samples. These findings imply that the prevalence of diagnosed patients (~1:325,000) may indeed correspond the true prevalence of GD in Finland. The SNP chip genotype data is a valuable tool that complements the screening with the GED-C PSS, especially if the genotyping pipeline is tuned for rare variants.

A deep learning model was used to segment the retinal pigment epithelium. The macular curvature of the OCT scans was calculated by polynomial fit and evaluated. Further, associations with demographic, functional, ocular, and infancy factors were examined. The overall macular curvature values followed a Gaussian distribution with high inter-eye agreement. Although all of the investigated parameters, except maternal smoking, were associated with the curvature in a multilinear analysis, ethnicity and refractive error consistently revealed the most significant effect. The prevalence of a macular dome-shaped configuration was 4.8% overall, most commonly in Chinese subjects as well as hypermetropic eyes. An increasing frequency up to 22.0% was found toward high refractive error. Subretinal fluid was rarely found in these eyes. Macular curvature revealed associations with demographic, functional, ocular, and infancy factors, as well as increasing prevalence of a dome-shaped macular configuration in high refractive error including high myopia and hypermetropia.

Global prevalence estimates of Fabry disease based on clinical ascertainment range from 1 in 40 000 to 1 in 170 000. We aimed to determine the prevalence of Fabry disease-causing variants in UK Biobank. We sought  gene variants in exome sequencing data from 200 643 individuals from UK Biobank. We used ACMG/AMP guidelines (American College of Medical Genetics/Association for Molecular Pathology) to classify pathogenicity and compared baseline biomarker data, hospital ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases version-10) codes, general practitioner records and self-reported health data with those without pathogenic variants. We identified 81  coding variants. We identified eight likely pathogenic variants on the basis of being rare (<1/10 000 individuals) and either previously reported to cause Fabry disease, or being protein-truncating variants. Thirty-six individuals carried one of these variants. In the UK Biobank, the prevalence of likely pathogenic Fabry disease-causing variants is 1/5732 for late-onset disease-causing variants and 1/200 643 for variants causing classic Fabry disease. Fabry disease-causing  variants are more prevalent in an unselected population sample than the reported prevalence of Fabry disease. These are overwhelmingly variants associated with later onset. It is possible the prevalence of later-onset Fabry disease exceeds current estimates.",,,Humans;Fabry Disease;Prevalence;Biological Specimen Banks;Mutation;alpha-Galactosidase;United Kingdom;Cardiovascular Diseases;Genetics;Nephrology;Screening;

As these biobanks are increasingly asked to share their data, including for example, genome-wide analyses, questions arise about how such decisions are made, including whether applicants' research aligns with the aims of the biobank. To better understand how biobanks make decisions relating to their data use, we sought the views and experiences of those involved in decision-making relating to data access at 11 large-scale publicly funded health biobanks. We were particularly interested in how potentially contentious applications were approached. Interviewees had some concerns about decisions on applications they felt their governance structures could not reach. We ask broader questions about the responsibility of those involved in biobank access decisions-those working early in the research process-when considering such issues.",,,biobank;biobanking;data access committees;responsible innovation;

We applied and evaluated two intergenerational instrumental variable methods to estimate the average causal effect of BMI on mortality in a cohort with many deaths: the parents of UK Biobank participants. In Cox regression models, parental BMI was instrumented by offspring BMI using an 'offspring as instrument' (OAI) estimation and by offspring BMI-related genetic variants in a 'proxy-genotype Mendelian randomization' (PGMR) estimation. Complete-case analyses were performed in parents of 233 361 UK Biobank participants with full phenotypic, genotypic and covariate data. The PGMR method suggested that higher BMI increased mortality with hazard ratios per kg/m2 of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) for mothers and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.05) for fathers. The OAI method gave considerably higher estimates, which varied according to the parent-offspring pairing between 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.10; mother-son) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.29; father-daughter). Both methods supported a causal role of higher BMI increasing mortality, although caution is required regarding the immediate causal interpretation of these exact values. Evidence of instrument invalidity from measured covariates was limited for the OAI method and minimal for the PGMR method. The methods are complementary for interrogating the average putative causal effects because the biases are expected to differ between them.",,,Female;Humans;Body Mass Index;Biological Specimen Banks;Obesity;Mothers;United Kingdom;Mendelian Randomization Analysis;Mendelian randomization;UK Biobank;body mass index;instrumental variable;intergenerational;mortality;offspring as instrument;proxy genotype;

Major challenges include suboptimal phenotype mapping and limited statistical power. Population biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, recruit many individuals who can be affected by rare diseases; however, investigation into their utility for rare disease research remains limited. We hypothesized the UK Biobank can be used as a unique population assay for rare diseases in the general population. We constructed a consensus mapping between ICD-10 codes and ORPHA codes for rare diseases, then identified individuals with each rare condition in the UK Biobank, and investigated their age at recruitment, sex bias, and comorbidity distributions. Using exome sequencing data from 167,246 individuals of European ancestry, we performed genetic association controlling for case/control imbalance (SAIGE) to identify potential rare pathogenic variants for each disease. Using our mapping approach, we identified and characterized 420 rare diseases affecting 23,575 individuals in the UK Biobank. Significant genetic associations included JAK2 V617F for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (p = 1.24 × 10) and a novel CALR loss of function variant for essential thrombocythemia (p = 1.59 × 10). We constructed an interactive resource highlighting demographic information ( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mattpat/rareDiseases.html ) and demonstrate transferability by applying our mapping to a medical claims database.

Here, we apply our recently developed Bayesian grouped mixture of regressions model (GMRM) in the UK and Estonian Biobanks and obtain the highest genomic prediction accuracy reported to date across 21 heritable traits. When compared to other approaches, GMRM accuracy was greater than annotation prediction models run in the LDAK or LDPred-funct software by 15% (SE 7%) and 14% (SE 2%), respectively, and was 18% (SE 3%) greater than a baseline BayesR model without single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers grouped into minor allele frequency-linkage disequilibrium (MAF-LD) annotation categories. For height, the prediction accuracy  was 47% in a UK Biobank holdout sample, which was 76% of the estimated [Formula: see text]. We then extend our GMRM prediction model to provide mixed-linear model association (MLMA) SNP marker estimates for genome-wide association (GWAS) discovery, which increased the independent loci detected to 16,162 in unrelated UK Biobank individuals, compared to 10,550 from BoltLMM and 10,095 from Regenie, a 62 and 65% increase, respectively. The average [Formula: see text] value of the leading markers increased by 15.24 (SE 0.41) for every 1% increase in prediction accuracy gained over a baseline BayesR model across the traits.

However, whilst biobanks provide a crucial service, their efficient and effective management can prove challenging. When establishing a biobank many factors should be considered, such as the need for appropriate infrastructure, equipment, financial support, and highly specialised and suitably qualified personnel. The number and qualifications of the necessary personnel depend both on the biobank's size and type - i.e. a biobank that is large and diversified in terms of the stored material should be organised differently to a small biorepository. The core of the biobank should be composed of highly trained personnel that closely co-operate with the general and quality control manager. Due to the large amount of data related to the samples, an IT specialist might be needed. In the case of large population biobanks, personnel responsible for patient recruitment, documentation handling, sample collection and distribution to the biobank would be necessary. Furthermore, staff responsible for the infrastructure are also highly important, as they are the first responders to failures that may be critical for the biobank functioning. Depending on the type and size of the biobank/biorepository, some responsibilities and tasks could potentially be combined.

In this study, we systematically assessed the association of MSY genetic variation on these traits using a kin-cohort analysis of family disease history in the largest sample to date. We tested 90 MSY haplogroups against coronary artery disease, hypertension, blood pressure, classical lipid levels, and all-cause mortality in up to 152 186 unrelated, genomically British individuals from UK Biobank. Unlike previous studies, we did not adjust for heritable lifestyle factors (to avoid collider bias) and instead adjusted for geographic variables and socioeconomic deprivation, given the link between MSY haplogroups and geography. For family history traits, subject MSY haplogroups were tested against father and mother disease as validation and negative control, respectively. Our models find little evidence for an effect of any MSY haplogroup on cardiovascular risk in participants. Parental models confirm these findings. Kin-cohort analysis of the Y chromosome uniquely allows for discoveries in subjects to be validated using family history data. Despite our large sample size, improved models, and parental validation, there is little evidence to suggest cardiovascular risk in UK Biobank is influenced by genetic variation in MSY.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Chromosomes, Human, Y;Coronary Artery Disease;Humans;Male;Phenotype;United Kingdom;Y Chromosome;blood pressure;chromosomes, human, Y;coronary artery disease;genetic variation;hypertension;mortality"

Traditional cancer biobanks typically contain normal and tumor tissues, and matched blood. However, biospecimens in traditional biobanks are usually nonrenewable. In recent years, increased interest has focused on establishing living biobanks, including organoid biobanks, for the collection and storage of viable and functional tissues for long periods of time. The organoid model is based on a 3D  cell culture system, is highly similar to primary tissues and organs , and can recapitulate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of target organs. Publications on cancer organoids have recently increased, and many types of cancer organoids have been used for modeling cancer processes, as well as for drug discovery and screening. On the basis of the current research status, more exploration of cancer organoids through technical advancements is required to improve reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, given the natural characteristics of organoids, greater attention must be paid to ethical considerations. Here, we summarize recent advances in cancer organoid biobanking research, encompassing rectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, and glioblastoma cancers.

Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, sex and body mass index. In the UKB, PheWAS revealed 133 phenome codes (PheCodes) significantly associated with LP and most of them were confirmed in PMBB. Dermatological and digestive PheCodes were the most abundant: 29 and 34 of these disorders, respectively, were significantly overrepresented in LP individuals from both cohorts. The 29 dermatological and 12 oral disorders were often highly enriched, whereas hepatic, gastric, oesophageal and intestinal PheCodes displayed ORs in the range of 1·6-4·5. Several autoimmune disorders also exhibited OR > 5 in both cohorts.

We report a proof of principle study by metabolite fingerprinting applying UHPLC-MS of plasma and DBSs acquired from healthy adult dogs and cats (age range 1-9 years), representing each of 4 dog breeds (Labrador retriever, Beagle, Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen, and Norfolk terrier) and the British domestic shorthair cat (n = 10 per group). Blood samples (20 and 40 μL) for DBSs were loaded onto filter paper, air-dried at room temperature (3 h), and sealed and stored (4°C for ~72 h) prior to storage at -80°C. Plasma from the same blood draw (250 μL) was prepared and stored at -80°C within 1 h of sampling. Metabolite fingerprinting of the DBSs and plasma produced similar numbers of metabolite features that had similar abilities to discriminate between biological classes and correctly assign blinded samples. These provide evidence that DBSs, sampled in a manner amenable to application in in-clinic/in-field processing, are a suitable sample for biomarker discovery using UHPLC-MS metabolomics. Further, given appropriate owner consent, the volumes tested (20-40 μL) make the acquisition of remnant blood from blood samples drawn for other reasons available for biobanking and other research activities. Together, this makes possible large-scale biobanking of veterinary samples, gaining sufficient material sooner and enabling quicker identification of biomarkers of interest.",,,biobank;biomarker;cat;dog;dried blood spots (DBSs);metabolomics;

The evidence, however, remains limited and mechanisms unclear. We aimed to investigate these associations within UK Biobank, and to examine the role of underlying chronic disease as a potential mechanism. UK Biobank COVID-19 positive laboratory test results were ascertained via Public Health England and general practitioner record linkage, COVID-19 hospitalisations via Hospital Episode Statistics, and COVID-19 mortality via Office for National Statistics mortality records from March-December 2020. We used annual average outdoor air pollution modelled at 2010 residential addresses of UK Biobank participants who resided in England (n = 424,721). We obtained important COVID-19 risk factors from baseline UK Biobank questionnaire responses (2006-2010) and general practitioner record linkage. We used logistic regression models to assess associations of air pollution with COVID-19 outcomes, adjusted for relevant confounders, and conducted sensitivity analyses. We found positive associations of fine particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO) with COVID-19 positive test result after adjustment for confounders and COVID-19 risk factors, with odds ratios of 1.05 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.02, 1.08), and 1.05 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.08), respectively. PM 2.5 and NO 2 were positively associated with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in minimally adjusted models, but not in fully adjusted models. No associations for PM were found. In analyses with additional adjustment for pre-existing chronic disease, effect estimates were not substantially attenuated, indicating that underlying chronic disease may not fully explain associations.

This report details the ways in which we rapidly overcame those challenges to create a robust database of clinical information and patient samples while maintaining clinician and researcher safety. We developed a pipeline using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) to coordinate electronic informed consent, sample collection, immunological assay execution, and data analysis for biobanking samples from patients with COVID-19. We then integrated immunological assay data with clinical data extracted from the electronic health record to link study parameters with clinical readouts. Of the 193 inpatients who participated in this study, 138 consented electronically and 56 provided paper consent. We collected and banked blood samples to measure circulating cytokines and chemokines, peripheral immune cell composition and activation status, anti-COVID-19 antibodies, and germline gene polymorphisms. In addition, we collected DNA and RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs to assess viral titer and microbiome composition by 16S sequencing. The rapid spread and contagious nature of COVID-19 required special considerations and innovative solutions to biobank samples quickly while protecting researchers and clinicians. Overall, this workflow and computational pipeline allowed for comprehensive immune profiling of 193 inpatients infected with COVID-19, as well as 89 outpatients, 157 patients receiving curbside COVID-19 testing, and 86 healthy controls.

This study was undertaken to establish the perspectives of South African stakeholders (researchers, biobankers, clinicians, and research committee members) on sociocultural considerations in biobanking research.  This in-depth exploratory study used semistructured face-to-face or Skype interviews with 25 purposively selected stakeholders involved in the biobanking-related practice. The study sample comprised biobankers, clinicians, researchers, postgraduate students in biobanking research, and research ethics committee members in South Africa. The interview focused on social and cultural challenges facing the biobanking practice in the country. Further probes included stakeholder perspectives on ownership and custodianship of stored biosamples. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the collected data.  Several themes arose from the data analysis. These included respondents' perceptions of poor understanding of biobanking among research participants and communities; inconsistency in defining ownership and custodianship of biosamples; variability in respondents' understanding of cultural, religious, and social implications of biobanking; the notion of distrust; and building trust in biobanking. There were also inconsistencies in respondents' recognition of social, cultural, and/or religious influences on participant decision-making in biobanking research. Respondents highlighted that a general climate of distrust existed in the biobanking practice in South Africa.  There is a need for greater stakeholder awareness of sociocultural considerations in biobanking practice in South Africa. One possible way to achieve this could be through the availability of training programs aimed at improving stakeholder understanding of the sociocultural context for biobanking practice in addition to greater efforts at community engagement with respect to all biobanking activities and research.",,,Humans;South Africa;Biological Specimen Banks;biobanking;biological samples;cultural;social;

The National Cancer Institute's mandate for Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCCs) to define and assume responsibility for cancer control and treatment across a geographic catchment area provides an enforceable mechanism to target and potentially remediate participatory inequities. We examined enrollee characteristics across 15 Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance cooperative group adult acute leukemia clinical trials (N = 3,734) from 1998 to 2013, including participation in optional companion biobanks. We determined enrollment odds by race-ethnicity for all participants adjusted for national incidence, and for those enrolled at CCCs adjusted for catchment area incidence. We modeled biobank participation by sociodemographics using logistic regression. Non-Hispanic (NH)-White patients were more likely to be enrolled than NH-Black, NH-Asian, or Hispanic patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.75, 0.48, and 0.44, respectively; all  < .001), but less likely than NH-Native American patients (OR, 1.91;  < .001), adjusted for national incidence. Enrollment odds were lower for NH-Black, NH-Asian, and Hispanic patients at CCCs adjusted for catchment area incidence (OR, 0.57, 0.26, and 0.32, respectively;  < .001); differences were driven by overenrollment of NH-White patients from outside self-defined catchment areas (18.1%  12.3%; χ  = .01) and by CCCs with less absolute enrollee diversity (rank sum  = .03). Among all enrollees, NH-White race-ethnicity and lower neighborhood deprivation correlated with biobank participation (OR, 1.81 and 1.45, respectively;  = .01 and .03). For CCC enrollees, the correlation of race-ethnicity with biobank participation was attenuated by a measure accounting for their site's degree of enrollment disparity but not neighborhood deprivation.

However, the current evidence is primarily based on data from Western countries. We examined the association of OPA with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in working adults in urban China. This prospective longitudinal study was based on a sample of 142,302 urban working adults aged 30-79 years from the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Self-reported OPA (mainly sedentary, standing occupation, and manual work) was collected at baseline (year 2004-2008) and linked to death registries until 31st December 2016. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship between OPA and mortality outcomes, with further tests for effect modification by sex, educational attainment and LTPA. During a median follow-up of 10·2 years, 4,077 deaths occurred, of which cardiovascular disease was the primary cause for 727 deaths. Crude modelling showed that compared with the sedentary workers, manual work was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. However, after adjusting for socio-demographic and lifestyle variables, the association was attenuated to null (HR=1·00, 95%CI: 0·93-1·08). In subgroup analysis, higher OPA was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality in the least educated group (HR=0·84, 95%CI: 0·75-0·95 for manual work, and HR=0·86, 95%CI: 0·75-0·99 for standing occupation), but harmful in the most educated group (HR=1·17, 95%CI: 1·01-1·36) and in those who reported regular LTPA (HR=1·20, 95%CI: 1·01-1·43).

Guidelines recommend adjustment of treatment targets in people with frailty or multimorbidity. It is unclear how recommendations to adjust treatment targets in people with frailty or multimorbidity should be applied to different ages. We assess implications of frailty/multimorbidity in middle/older-aged people with T2D. We analysed UK Biobank participants ( = 20,566) with T2D aged 40-72 years comparing two frailty measures (Fried frailty phenotype and Rockwood frailty index) and two multimorbidity measures (Charlson Comorbidity index and count of long-term conditions (LTCs)). Outcomes were mortality, Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE), hospitalization with hypoglycaemia or fall/fracture. Here we show  that choice of measure influences the population identified: 42% of participants are frail or multimorbid by at least one measure; 2.2% by all four measures. Each measure is associated with mortality, MACE, hypoglycaemia, and fall or fracture. The absolute 5-year mortality risk is higher in older versus younger participants with a given level of frailty (e.g. 1.9%, and 9.9% in men aged 45 and 65, respectively, using frailty phenotype) or multimorbidity (e.g. 1.3%, and 7.8% in men with 4 LTCs aged 45 and 65, respectively). Using frailty phenotype, the relationship between higher HbA1c and mortality is stronger in frail compared with pre-frail or robust participants. Assessment of frailty/multimorbidity should be embedded within routine management of middle-aged and older people with T2D. Method of identification as well as features such as age impact baseline risk and should influence clinical decisions (e.g. glycaemic control).",,,Epidemiology;Type 2 diabetes;

Moreover, previous studies of hemodialysis patients showed that AAC was correlated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and predicted CVD jointly. Whether the effects remained in the general population is unknown. We examined the associations of AAC with all-cause mortality and CVD in general population and the risk associated with the coexistence of AAC and LVH. Presence and severity (grades 0-2) of AAC were measured by chest X-ray, and LVH was identified by 12-lead electrocardiogram in 27,166 Chinese aged 50+ years free of CVD from Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Multivariate Cox regressions were used to examine associations of AAC and LVH with outcomes. During an average follow-up of 14·3 years, 5,350 deaths and 4,012 CVD occurred. Compared to those without AAC at baseline, those with AAC had higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR 1·24, 95% CI 1·17-1·31) and CVD (HR 1·22, 95% CI 1·14-1·30), with dose-response relationship (P ≤ 0·001).

Since it is a challenging process, we sought to develop a protocol that improves the fidelity and quantity of biobanked primary prostate cancer (CaP) tissue. We conducted a pilot study evaluating pathologic concordance of biobanked tissue and the radical prostatectomy specimen using either standard protocol (SP) vs. next-generation protocol (NGP). There were no significant differences in clinical and pathologic characteristics (age, BMI, preoperative PSA, prostate weight, race, final prostatectomy Gleason score, or pathologic tumor and nodal stages) between the two protocol arms. Utilization of the NGP compared to the standard protocol resulted in a significantly higher rate of pathologic concordance between the biobanked and RP specimens (61.8% vs. 37.9%, P = 0.0231) as well as a nearly two-fold increase in the amount of biobanked tumor tissue (330 mm vs. 174 mm, P < 0.001).

However, the reports of personality's mediating role have been inconsistent with no data available from large population-based cohorts. The study aimed to create proxies for the Big Five personality traits, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness and neuroticism, to examine the longitudinal relationship between personality and myocardial infarction in the UK Biobank. The study sample comprised of 484,205 participants (55% female, 45% male, mean age 56.4 ± 8.1 years) from UK Biobank cohort with a mean follow-up of 7 years. The personality proxies sociability, warmth, diligence, curiosity and nervousness were created using self-reported data on psychological factors, mental health and social support, to match the facets of the Big Five traits. As neuroticism is the only Big Five personality trait available in the UK Biobank, it was included to validate the personality proxies. Myocardial infarction outcome information was collected from hospital records, death registries or was self-reported. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratios (HR), respectively with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity), health-related factors (BMI, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and lifestyle factors (alcohol intake, smoking, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity). Diligence was found to be significantly associated with lower prevalent myocardial infarction [OR: 0.87; (CI 0.84-0.89)] and lower incident myocardial infarction [HR: 0.88; (CI 0.85-0.92)]. Sociability was also protective against prevalent [OR: 0.89; (CI 0.87-0.92)] and incident [HR: 0.90; (CI 0.87-0.93)] myocardial infarction. Conversely, nervousness inferred a higher risk for both prevalent [OR: 1.10; (CI 1.08-1.12)] and incident [HR: 1.07; (CI 1.04-1.09)] myocardial infarction during follow-up. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that nervousness significantly increases the risk for incident myocardial infarction among women [HR: 1.13; (CI 1.08-1.19)] compared to men [HR: 1.05; (CI 1.02-1.08)]. By using our created proxies, we were able to investigate the impact of personality on the development of myocardial infarction. Persons with higher levels of diligence and sociability mimicking predominantly conscientiousness and extraversion personalities respectively are less likely to experience myocardial infarction, while personalities predominantly characterised by nervousness pose higher risk for developing myocardial infarction. These initial findings invite further validation of the use of the personality proxies in UK Biobank cohort.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Myocardial Infarction;Personality;United Kingdom;

The multifactorial etiopathogenesis of RA has been heavily investigated, but is still only partially understood. Diet can represent both a risk factor and a protective factor, based on some evidence that suggests specific properties of certain foods and their ability to increase/reduce inflammation. To date, the studies done on this topic provide discordant results and are heterogeneous in terms of design and cohort size. In this work, we investigated for the first time the relationship between nutrition and the risk of RA onset using a sample size of about half a million subjects from one of the largest publicly available biobanks that is the UK biobank. Results showed that oily fish, alcohol, coffee and breakfast cereals have protective roles in RA; whereas, tea can increase the risk of RA. In conclusion, the obtained results confirm that diet plays key roles in RA, either by promoting or by preventing RA onset and development. Future research should focus on unravelling the effects of dietary habits on immune-mediated diseases to establish better preventive strategies.",,,"Animals;Arthritis, Rheumatoid;Biological Specimen Banks;Coffee;Humans;Nutritional Status;United Kingdom;UK biobank;autoimmunity;dietary habits;rheumatoid arthritis"

A proper understanding of patients' demographics and health factors is essential in constructing high-quality health care services toward Chinese or Western medicine. The objective of this study was to understand the tendency among Taiwanese to opt for either Chinese or Western medicine when both services are available. This study was based on the analysis of secondary data. A total of 13,151 individuals with an age of 30 years or more were selected from the Taiwan Biobank Research Database in Taiwan. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with health-seeking behaviors toward Chinese or Western medicine. Among all the participants, 50.8% showed a greater tendency to seek Western medicine treatment, while 10.4% showed a preference for Chinese medicine treatment. Main drivers for a Chinese medicine health-seeking behavior were women, hypotension, low income, normal HbA1c, normal total cholesterol, and yang deficiency. The preference for Western medicine treatment was associated mainly with men, an older age, a married status, lower income, a lower education, an abnormal cholesterol level, and the absence of stasis. Healthcare providers should understand the factors associated with health-seeking behavior and refer patients to their desired treatment.",,,"Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;China;Cholesterol;Female;Humans;Male;Medicine, Chinese Traditional;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Taiwan;Body constitution;Chinese medicine;Health-seeking behavior;Western medicine"

We report on the findings of a sub-study on participant understanding embedded in a multi-disease community health screening and biobank platform study known as 'Vukuzazi' in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research participants who had been invited to take part in the Vukuzazi study, including both participants and non-participants, and research staff that worked on the study. The interviews were transcribed, and themes were identified from the interview transcripts, manually coded, and thematically analysed. Thirty-nine individuals were interviewed. We found that the research team explained biobanking and future genomic research by describing how hereditary characteristics create similarities among individuals. However, recollection and understanding of this explanation seven months after participation was variable. The large volume of information about the Vukuzazi study objectives and procedures presented a challenge to participant recall. By the time of interviews, some participants recalled rudimentary facts about the genetic aspects of the study, but many expressed little to no interest in genetics and biobanking. Participant's understanding of information related to genetics and biobanking provided during the consent process is affected by the volume of information as well as participant's interest (or lack thereof) in the subject matter being discussed. We recommend that future studies undertaking biobanking and genomic research treat explanations of this kind of research to participants as an on-going process of communication between researchers, participants and the community and that explanatory imagery and video graphic storytelling should be incorporated into theses explanations as these have previously been found to facilitate understanding among those with low literacy levels. Studies should also avoid having broader research objectives as this can divert participant's interest and therefore understanding of why their samples are being collected.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Genome;Humans;Informed Consent;Public Health;South Africa;Biobanking;Ethics;Genomic research;Informed consent;Participant experiences;Researcher experiences;

However, the association between AChB and dementia held only for some classes of drugs, especially antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antidiuretics. The heterogeneity in previous findings may partially be due to different effects for different classes of drugs.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for PCa (6747 incident cases) across seven sleep traits (sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia, snoring, nap, difficulty to get up in the morning, and daytime sleepiness). In addition, we newly created a healthy sleep quality score according to sleep traits to assess the impact of the overall status of night and daytime sleep on PCa development. E values were used to assess unmeasured confounding. We identified 6747 incident cases, of which 344 died from PCa.

Cases of primary dysmenorrhea included those who self-reported  frequent dysmenorrhea  in a dysmenorrhea-related Taiwan Biobank questionnaire, and those who have been diagnosed with severe dysmenorrhea by a physician. Controls were those without self-reported dysmenorrhea. Customized Axiom-Taiwan Biobank Array Plates were used to perform whole-genome genotyping, PLINK was used to perform association tests, and HaploReg was used to conduct functional annotations of SNPs and bioinformatic analyses. The GWAS analysis included 1186 cases and 24,020 controls. We identified 53 SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10, which clustered in 2 regions. The first SNP cluster was on chromosome 1, and included 24 high LD (R > 0.88) variants around the NGF gene (lowest P value of 3.83 × 10 for rs2982742). Most SNPs occurred within NGF introns, and were predicted to alter regulatory binding motifs. The second SNP cluster was on chromosome 2, including 7 high LD (R > 0.94) variants around the IL1A and IL1B loci (lowest P value of 7.43 × 10 for rs11676014) and 22 SNPs that did not reach significance after conditional analysis. Most of these SNPs resided within IL1A and IL1B introns, while 2 SNPs may be in the promoter histone marks or promoter flanking regions of IL1B.

People with RA identified from the Scottish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) inception cohort (newly diagnosed, mean age 58.2 years) and UK Biobank (established disease identified using diagnostic codes, mean age 59 years). Frailty was quantified using the frailty index (both datasets) and frailty phenotype (UK Biobank only). Disease activity was assessed using Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) in SERA. Associations between baseline frailty and all-cause mortality and hospitalisation was estimated after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking and alcohol, plus DAS28 in SERA. Based on the frailty index, frailty was common in SERA (12% moderate, 0.2% severe) and UK Biobank (20% moderate, 3% severe). In UK Biobank, 23% were frail using frailty phenotype. Frailty index was associated with DAS28 in SERA, as well as age and female sex in both cohorts. In SERA, as DAS28 lessened over time with treatment, mean frailty index also decreased.

They are an important component of clinical research in many disease areas and often represent the first step toward innovative treatments. For biobanks to operate, researchers need human participants to give their samples and associated health data. In Ireland, research participants must provide their freely given informed consent for their samples and data to be taken and used for research purposes. Biobank staff are responsible for communicating the relevant information to participants prior to obtaining their consent, and this communication process is supported by documentation in the form of Participant Information Leaflets and Informed Consent Forms (PILs/ICFs). PILs/ICFs should be concise, intelligible, and contain relevant information. While not a substitute for layperson and research staff discussions, PILs and ICFs ensure that a layperson has enough information to make an informed choice to participate or not.

Advances in biomedical research based on biobanks, however, are highly dependent on the successful enrolment and participation of human subjects. Therefore, it is crucial to recognise those factors affecting the willingness of individuals to participate in biomedical research. There are very few studies pointing to the role of trust, preferred values and specific psychological factors. The aim of our study was the analysis of the most significant relationships between selected moral and psychological variables (i.e., preferred values, types of trust and personality) and willingness to donate biological material to biobanks. The research was carried out on a Polish representative national sample of 1100 people over 18 years of age. Statistical methods with regression models were used during the analyses. The willingness to donate samples to a biobank was associated with different types of trust and specific values. Based on regression analysis, the most important factors related to the willingness to donate material to biobanks seemed to be (1) trust towards scientists and doctors and (2) selected preferred values such as knowledge, self-development and tradition. Other values or personality traits did not seem to be as important in this context.

This study aims to compare associations between multimorbidity and adverse health outcomes in UK Biobank and a nationally representative sample. These are observational analyses of cohorts identified from linked routine healthcare data from UK Biobank participants (n = 211,597 from England, Scotland, and Wales with linked primary care data, age 40 to 70, mean age 56.5 years, 54.6% women, baseline assessment 2006 to 2010) and from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank (n = 852,055 from Wales, age 40 to 70, mean age 54.2, 50.0% women, baseline January 2011). Multimorbidity (n = 40 long-term conditions [LTCs]) was identified from primary care Read codes and quantified using a simple count and a weighted score. Individual LTCs and LTC combinations were also assessed. Associations with all-cause mortality, unscheduled hospitalisation, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were assessed using Weibull or negative binomial models adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic status, over 7.5 years follow-up for both datasets. Multimorbidity was less common in UK Biobank than SAIL (26.9% and 33.0% with ≥2 LTCs in UK Biobank and SAIL, respectively). This difference was attenuated, but persisted, after standardising by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The association between increasing multimorbidity count and mortality, hospitalisation, and MACE was similar between both datasets at LTC counts of ≤3; however, above this level, UK Biobank underestimated the risk associated with multimorbidity (e.g., mortality hazard ratio for 2 LTCs 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.57 to 1.68) in SAIL and 1.51 (1.43 to 1.59) in UK Biobank, hazard ratio for 5 LTCs was 3.46 (3.31 to 3.61) in SAIL and 2.88 (2.63 to 3.15) in UK Biobank). Absolute risk of mortality, hospitalisation, and MACE, at all levels of multimorbidity, was lower in UK Biobank than SAIL (adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status). Both cohorts produced similar hazard ratios for some LTCs (e.g., hypertension and coronary heart disease), but UK Biobank underestimated the risk for others (e.g., alcohol-related disorders or mental health conditions). Hazard ratios for some LTC combinations were similar between the cohorts (e.g., cardiovascular conditions); however, UK Biobank underestimated the risk for combinations including other conditions (e.g., mental health conditions). The main limitations are that SAIL databank represents only part of the UK (Wales only) and that in both cohorts we lacked data on severity of the LTCs included. In this study, we observed that UK Biobank accurately estimates relative risk of mortality, unscheduled hospitalisation, and MACE associated with LTC counts ≤3. However, for counts ≥4, and for some LTC combinations, estimates of magnitude of association from UK Biobank are likely to be conservative. Researchers should be mindful of these limitations of UK Biobank when conducting and interpreting analyses of multimorbidity. Nonetheless, the richness of data available in UK Biobank does offers opportunities to better understand multimorbidity, particularly where complementary data sources less susceptible to selection bias can be used to inform and qualify analyses of UK Biobank.",,,"Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Multimorbidity;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Scotland"

With the increasing availability of genetic data in large cohort studies such as the UK Biobank, inclusion of this genetic risk as a covariate in statistical analyses is becoming more widespread. Previously this required specialist knowledge, but as tooling and data availability have improved it has become more feasible for statisticians and epidemiologists to calculate existing scores themselves for use in analyses. While tutorial resources exist for conducting genome-wide association studies and generating of new polygenic risk scores, fewer guides exist for the simple calculation and application of existing genetic scores. This guide outlines the key steps of this process: selection of suitable polygenic risk scores from the literature, extraction of relevant genetic variants and verification of their quality, calculation of the risk score and key considerations of its inclusion in statistical models, using the UK Biobank imputed data as a model data set. Many of the techniques in this guide will generalize to other datasets, however we also focus on some of the specific techniques required for using data in the formats UK Biobank have selected. This includes some of the challenges faced when working with large numbers of variants, where the computation time required by some tools is impractical. While we have focused on only a couple of tools, which may not be the best ones for every given aspect of the process, one barrier to working with genetic data is the sheer volume of tools available, and the difficulty for a novice to assess their viability. By discussing in depth a couple of tools that are adequate for the calculation even at large scale, we hope to make polygenic risk scores more accessible to a wider range of researchers.",,,UK biobank;genetic risk score;polygenic risk score;polygenic score;worked example;

At the University of Tsukuba, we have started the on-demand distribution in which it is provided prospectively collected biospecimens that researchers require for their research in parallel with the retrospective distribution. The protocol for distribution of biospecimens will be prepared by biobank, and will be coordinated between the clinical doctor and the user by biobank. This makes it possible to provide biospecimens smoothly. On-demand distribution is a new providing style of prospectively collected biospecimens as biobanks, and is expected to promote medical and drug discovery research, including cancer research.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Neoplasms;Retrospective Studies;

To compare effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on lipid and glycaemic control in men and women with and without T2DM, and their association with incident T2DM. The effect of simvastatin and atorvastatin on lipid and glycaemic control was assessed in the T2DM DiaStrat cohort. Prescribed medications, gender, age, BMI, diabetes duration, blood lipid profile and HbA1c were extracted from Electronic Care Record, and compared in men and women prescribed simvastatin and atorvastatin. Analyses were replicated in the UKBiobank in those with and without T2DM. The association of simvastatin and atorvastatin with incident T2DM was also investigated in the UKBiobank. Cohorts where matched for age, BMI and diabetes duration in men and women, in the UKBioBank analysis, where possible.

In addition, with the increase in medical imaging data, automatic image processing with image recognition has been widely studied and applied in biomedicine. However, case-control data imbalance often occurs in human biobanks, which is usually solved by the statistical method SAIGE. Due to the huge amount of genetic data in human biobanks, the direct use of the SAIGE method often faces the problem of insufficient computer memory to support calculations and excessive calculation time. The other method is to use sampling to adjust the data to balance the case-control ratio, which is called Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Our study employed the Manhattan plot and genetic disease information from the Taiwan Biobank to adjust the imbalance in the case-control ratio by SMOTE, called  TW-SMOTE.  We further used a deep learning image recognition system to identify the TW-SMOTE. We found that TW-SMOTE can achieve the same results as that of SAIGE and the UK Biobank (UKB). The processing of the technical data can be equivalent to the use of data plots with a relatively large UKB sample size and achieve the same effect as that of SAIGE in addressing data imbalance.",,,biobank;deep learning;genome-wide association analyses;image identification;imbalanced data;mManhattan plot;

One among these is the study of biomarker trajectories. For example, high blood pressure measurements over visits strongly predict stroke onset, and consistently high fasting glucose and Hb1Ac levels define diabetes. Recent research reveals that not only the mean level of biomarker trajectories but also their fluctuations, or within-subject (WS) variability, are risk factors for many diseases. Glycemic variation, for instance, is recently considered an important clinical metric in diabetes management. It is crucial to identify the genetic factors that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. Compared to traditional cross-sectional studies, trajectory analysis utilizes more data points and captures a complete picture of the impact of time-varying factors, including medication history and lifestyle. Currently, there are no efficient tools for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of biomarker trajectories at the biobank scale, even for just mean effects. We propose TrajGWAS, a linear mixed effect model-based method for testing genetic effects that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. It is scalable to biobank data with 100,000 to 1,000,000 individuals and many longitudinal measurements and robust to distributional assumptions. Simulation studies corroborate that TrajGWAS controls the type I error rate and is powerful. Analysis of eleven biomarkers measured longitudinally and extracted from UK Biobank primary care data for more than 150,000 participants with 1,800,000 observations reveals loci that significantly alter the mean or WS variability.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Cross-Sectional Studies;Electronic Health Records;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;biobank;biomarkers;disease progression;electronic medical records;longitudinal;trend;variations;within-subject variability;

For brain cancer researchers, a major obstacle to biomarker driven research is limited access to brain cancer tissue for research purposes. The Mark Hughes Foundation Brain Biobank is one of the first post-mortem adult brain banks in Australia to operate with protocols specifically developed for brain cancer. Located within the Hunter New England Local Health District and operated by Hunter Cancer Biobank, the boundaries of service provided by the Brain Bank extend well into the surrounding regional and rural areas of the Local Health District and beyond. Brain cancer biobanking is challenging. There are conflicting international guidelines for best practice and unanswered questions relating to scientific, psychosocial and operational practices. To address this challenge, a best practice model was developed, informed by a consensus of existing data but with consideration of the difficulties associated with operating in regional or resource poor settings. The regional application of this model was challenged following the presentation of a donor located in a remote area, 380km away from the biobank. This required biobank staff to overcome numerous obstacles including long distance patient transport, lack of palliative care staff, death in the home and limited rural outreach services. Through the establishment of shared goals, contingency planning and the development of an informal infrastructure, the donation was facilitated within the required timeframe. This experience demonstrates the importance of collaboration and networking to overcome resource insufficiency and geographical challenges in rural cancer research programmes.",,,Biobanking;Brain;Cancer;

The aim of the present work was to develop a sensitive LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantitation of xanthine, hypoxanthine, UA, allantoin, and creatinine in biobanked urine samples. This article describes details and performance of the new method studied in 55 samples of human urine. Archival sample preparation and effect of storage conditions on stability of the analytes are addressed. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were small for all the analytes, not exceeding 1% and 10%, respectively. Measurements of UA and creatinine in biobanked urine showed good agreement with values obtained using routine enzymatic assays on fresh urine. Spearman's correlation coefficients were 0.869 ( < .001) for creatinine and 0.964 ( < .001) for UA.

When stratified by study time, an inverse association was observed in early follow-up among those entering the cohort in early years (2006-2008; HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.95). No heterogeneity was observed by age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While there was no association between glucosamine use and colorectal cancer overall, the inverse association among never-screened individuals mirrors our observations in prior exploratory analyses of U.S. cohorts. The National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Program started in 2006 in England and was more widely implemented across the UK by 2009/2010. In line with this, we observed an inverse association limited to early follow-up in those surveyed from 2006 to 2008, before screening was widely implemented. These data suggest that unscreened individuals may benefit from use of glucosamine; however, further studies are needed to confirm the interplay of screening and timing.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Colorectal Neoplasms;Glucosamine;Humans;Proportional Hazards Models;Risk Factors;State Medicine;United Kingdom;

In dentistry, biological materials and data obtained from questionnaires investigating oral conditions can be stored and used for large-scale studies on oral and systemic diseases. To give some examples: gene expression microarrays obtained on biobanked specimens were used in the identification of genetic alterations in oral cancer; efforts to identify genetic mechanisms behind dental caries have been based on an integrative analysis of transcriptome-wide associations and messenger RNA expression. One of the largest studies on facial pain was conducted using Biobank data. Cryopreservation of dental pulp stem cells is a common practice in tooth biobanks. With the exception of teeth and pulp, also leftover oral soft and hard tissues may represent a source of healthy samples that has rarely been exploited as yet. While biobanks are increasingly attracting the attention of the scientific community and becoming economically sustainable, a systematic approach to this resource in dentistry seems to be lacking. This review illustrates the applications of biobanking in dentistry, describing biobanked pathological and healthy samples and data, and discussing future developments.",,,Biobank;Dental pulp stem cells;Dentistry;Genetics;Oral cancer;Oral-systemic disease(s);

Our purpose is to review the existing image repositories fulfilling the criteria for imaging biobanks. Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for articles published in English from January 2010 to July 2021 using a combination of the terms:  imaging  AND  biobanks  and  imaging  AND  repository . Moreover, the Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) database ( https://cordis.europa.eu/projects ) was searched using the terms:  imaging  AND  biobanks , also including collections, projects, project deliverables, project publications and programmes. Of 9272 articles retrieved, only 54 related to biobanks containing imaging data were finally selected, of which 33 were disease-oriented (61.1%) and 21 population-based (38.9%). Most imaging biobanks were European (26/54, 48.1%), followed by American biobanks (20/54, 37.0%). Among disease-oriented biobanks, the majority were focused on neurodegenerative (9/33, 27.3%) and oncological diseases (9/33, 27.3%). The number of patients enrolled ranged from 240 to 3,370,929, and the imaging modality most frequently involved was MRI (40/54, 74.1%), followed by CT (20/54, 37.0%), PET (13/54, 24.1%), and ultrasound (12/54, 22.2%). Most biobanks (38/54, 70.4%) were accessible under request. Imaging biobanks can serve as a platform for collecting, sharing and analysing medical images integrated with imaging biomarkers, biological and clinical data. A relatively small proportion of current biobanks also contain images and can thus be classified as imaging biobanks. • Imaging biobanks are a powerful tool for large-scale collection and processing of medical images integrated with imaging biomarkers and patient non-imaging data. • Most imaging biobanks retrieved were European, disease-oriented and accessible under user request. • While many biobanks have been developed so far, only a relatively small proportion of them are imaging biobanks.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Databases, Factual;Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Precision Medicine;Artificial intelligence;Biomarkers;Diagnostic imaging"

In this community-based cohort study, we included 96,275 participants of the UK Biobank who had available SARS-CoV-2 test results in Public Health England. Of these, 2617 had a clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak of COVID-19 (defined as January 31st, 2020), while the remaining participants constituted the reference group. We then followed both groups from January 31st, 2020 to June 14th, 2021 for ascertainment of COVID-19 outcomes, including any COVID-19, inpatient care for COVID-19, and COVID-19 related death. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between neurogenerative disease and risks of COVID-19 outcomes, adjusted for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 outcomes among individuals with a neurodegenerative disease compared with the reference group, corresponding to a fully adjusted odds ratio of 2.47 (95%CI 2.25-2.71) for any COVID-19, 2.18 (95%CI 1.94-2.45) for inpatient COVID-19, and 3.67 (95%CI 3.11-4.34) for COVID-19 related death. Among individuals with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, individuals with neurodegenerative diseases had also a higher risk of COVID-19 related death than others (fully adjusted odds ratio 2.08; 95%CI 1.71-2.53).

Data from these devices are often used to summarise such activity in terms of averages, variances, exceedances, and patterns within a profile. In this study, we report the development of a clustering utilising the whole activity profile. This was achieved using the robust clustering technique of k-medoids applied to an extensive data set of over 90,000 activity profiles, collected as part of the UK Biobank study. We identified nine distinct activity profiles in these data, which captured both the pattern of activity throughout a week and the intensity of the activity:  Active 9 to 5 ,  Active ,  Morning Movers ,  Get up and Active ,  Live for the Weekend ,  Moderates ,  Leisurely 9 to 5 ,  Sedate  and  Inactive . These patterns are differentiated by sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health and circadian rhythm data collected by UK Biobank. The utility of these findings are that they sit alongside existing summary measures of physical activity to provide a way to typify distinct activity patterns that may help to explain other health and morbidity outcomes, e.g., BMI or COVID-19.

This study explored stakeholder perspectives on training needs in biobanking research and the use of an online training platform for such educational purposes.  An exploratory study design using qualitative data was used. The study sample comprised selected stakeholders ( = 25) including biobankers, clinicians, researchers, postgraduate students, and research ethics committee members. Semi-structured in-person or Skype interviews were conducted and all ethical considerations were upheld. The interview focused on participants' perspectives on the accessibility and applicability of current available courses, and advantages and disadvantages of online biobanking courses. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.  The following themes arose from data analysis: inadequate availability of online courses, and advantages and disadvantages of online courses and opportunities for a successful training course. There was general consensus regarding the limited availability of context-specific training opportunities on the ELSI of biobanking. The majority of participants were previously self-taught and therefore relied on existing literature and collaborations with international biobanking groups for ongoing learning. Some respondents indicated that the costs of such available training courses were exorbitant. Some respondents also felt that available courses were not tailored to the specific needs of a diverse audience in biobanking. Apart from access, respondents reported possible challenges with internet connectivity and availability of data.  Respondents expressed a need for affordable and focused online educational opportunities in biobanking, but highlighted that these courses need to be contextualized and integrated into other learning activities.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Ethics Committees, Research;Humans;Research Personnel;South Africa;Students;biobanking;education;ethics;online training;stakeholders"

Ethicists and other stakeholders have disagreed, however, on the appropriate response to these failures in understanding. This paper describes an attempt to address this issue by conducting knowledge tests with 22 recent biobank enrollees, followed by in-depth, semistructured interviews about the goal of understanding in biobank consent. The interviews revealed that while biobank enrollees thought the information on the knowledge test was important, they did not think that performance on the test should affect whether individuals are permitted to enroll in a biobank. Three main themes emerged from the interviews: helping others by contributing to research is more important than understanding consent forms, less understanding is required because biobank-based research is low risk, and only a small amount of information in the consent form is really essential. These perspectives should be considered in discussing the ethics and governance of biobank consent processes.",,,Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Comprehension;Humans;Informed Consent;biobank research;biobanking;comprehension;human biospecimens;human research ethics;human subjects research;informed consent;precision medicine;understanding;

Cardiovascular tissue biobanking provides a unique opportunity to utilize cardiac and vascular samples for translational research into heart failure and other related pathologies. Current techniques for diagnosis, classification, and treatment monitoring of cardiac disease relies primarily on interpretation of clinical signs, imaging, and blood biomarkers. Further research at the disease source (i.e. myocardium and blood vessels) has been limited by a relative lack of access to quality human cardiac tissue and the inherent shortcomings of most animal models of heart disease. In this review, we describe a model for cardiovascular tissue biobanking and databasing, and its potential to facilitate basic and translational research. We share techniques to procure endocardial samples from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, in addition to aortic disease samples. We discuss some of the issues with respect to data collection, privacy, biobank consent, and the governance of tissue biobanking. The development of tissue biobanks as described here has significant scope to improve and facilitate translational research in multi-omic fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This research heralds an era of precision medicine, in which patients with cardiovascular pathology can be provided with optimized and personalized medical care for the treatment of their individual phenotype.",,,"Animals;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Genomics;Humans;Precision Medicine;Translational Research, Biomedical;Heart failure;Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy;Tissue biobanking;Translational research"

Drawing upon fieldwork and interviews with biobankers, we looked at which practices are highlighted for change to make biobanks worth maintaining and keep them afloat. We analysed these practices to unpack the values biobankers deploy to make sense of biobanking and turn it into two worthiness criteria: social return and dynamism. These criteria are intertwined and revolve around ethically calibrating the accumulation and sharing practices, 'sharing but not too much'. The porosity of biobanking practices and legislation, not to mention over a decade of austerity measures make biobanks fragile scientific infrastructures in Spain. We examine how biobanking practices are shifting in Spain to stay in the precarious techno-scientific present while challenging assumptions on cryopreservation and preparedness. Our local account highlights the relevance of further inquiries on shifts in biobanking to attend to which kinds of biomedical research and knowledge might be coproduced by such infrastructural reconfigurations.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Spain;Spain;biobanks;biomedicine;calibration;infrastructures;maintenance;sample underuse;techniques of accumulation;

Although multiple diseases will usually afflict patients at once or in succession, conventional PRSs fail to consider genetic relationships across multiple diseases. Even multi-trait PRSs, which take into account genetic effects for more than one disease at a time, fail to consider a sufficient number of phenotypes to accurately reflect the state of disease comorbidity in a patient, or are biased in terms of the traits that are selected. Thus, we developed novel network-based comorbidity risk scores to quantify associations among multiple phenotypes from phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We first constructed a disease-SNP heterogeneous multi-layered network (DS-Net), which consists of a disease network (disease-layer) and SNP network (SNP-layer). The disease-layer describes the population-level interactome from PheWAS data. The SNP-layer was constructed according to linkage disequilibrium. Both layers were attached to transform the information from a population-level interactome to individual-level inferences. Then, graph-based semi-supervised learning was applied to predict possible comorbidity scores on disease-layer for each subject. The SNP-layer serves as receiving individual genotyping data in the scoring process, and the disease-layer serves as the propagated output for an individual's multiple disease comorbidity scores. The possible comorbidity scores were combined by logistic regression, and it is denoted as netCRS. The DS-Net was constructed from UK Biobank PheWAS data, and the individual genetic profiles were collected from the Penn Medicine Biobank. As a proof-of-concept study, myocardial infarction (MI) was selected to compare netCRS with the PRS with pruning and thresholding (PRS-PT). The combined model (netCRS + PRS-PT + covariates) achieved an AUC improvement of 6.26% compared to the (PRS-PT + covariates) model. In terms of risk stratification, the combined model was able to capture the risk of MI up to approximately eight-fold higher than that of the low-risk group. The netCRS and PRS-PT complement each other in predicting high-risk groups of patients with MI. We expect that using these risk prediction models will allow for the development of prevention strategies and reduction of MI morbidity and mortality.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Computational Biology;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Multifactorial Inheritance;Myocardial Infarction;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Risk Factors"

This article aims at contributing to the ongoing debate on samples and data access governance in biobanking by presenting the case of the Telethon Network of Genetic Biobanks (TNGB). We attempt to contribute to the need for clear and available access criteria and harmonization in access arrangements to maximize the influence of biobanks in the progress of biomedical research. We reviewed all the sample requests submitted to the TNGB from 2008 to 2020, focusing on those rejected by the Access Committee and the reasons behind the rejections. The analysis of the reasons behind the rejected requests allowed us to analyze how those relate to the issues of scientific misconduct, prioritization, and noncompliance with the biobank's mission. We discuss those issues in light of the actions and motivations used by TNGB in the access decision-making process. Based on this analysis, we suggest that a cross-implementation of a checklist for access assessment would improve the whole access process, ensuring a more transparent and smoother governance. Finally, we conclude that the TNGB's Charter and approach toward access governance could contribute as an important reference point to deal with the issues that have emerged in the international discussion on the topic.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Access Committee;Ethical;Legal and Societal Issues;biobanking;governance;networking;sample and data access;

Since the primary goal in the management of cancer is to cure and improve survival, personalized therapy can increase survival, reduce mortality rates, and improve quality of life. Biobanks hold potential in leading to breakthroughs in biomedical research and precision medicine (PM). They serve as a biorepository, collecting, processing, storing, and supplying specimens and relevant data for basic, translational, and clinical research. We aimed to highlight the fundamental role of biobanks, harboring high quality, sustainable collections of patient samples in adequate size and variability, for developing diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers to develop and PM approaches in the management of HCC. We obtained information from previously published articles and BBMRI directory. Biobanking of high-quality biospecimens along with patient clinical information provides a fundamental scientific infrastructure for basic, translational, and clinical research. Biobanks that control and eliminate pre-analytical variability of biospecimens, provide a platform to identify reliable biomarkers for the application of PM. We believe, establishing HCC biobanks will empower to underpin molecular mechanisms of HCC and generate strategies for PM. Thus, first, we will review current therapy approaches in HCC care.

We investigated individuals' motives for participating in such projects and potential reasons for their withdrawal from participation in a population-based biobank. In addition, we analysed how these motives were related to various characteristics of the participants and their willingness to permit data linkage to their personal data for research. These questions were explored using a sample of participants in the Dutch Lifelines biobank (n = 2615). Our results indicated that motives for participation and withdrawal were premised on benefits or harm to society and to the individuals themselves. Although general values and trust both played key roles in participation, potential withdrawal and willingness to permit data linkage, they were differentially associated with motives for participation and withdrawal. These findings support and nuance previous findings by highlighting the distinctiveness and complexity of decision making regarding participation in or withdrawal from data donation. We suggest some new directions for improving recruitment, retention and safeguarding strategies in biobanking. In addition, our data provide initial evidence regarding how factors may relate with the probability that individuals will agree to data linkages, when controlling for their unique effects.

However, little is known about the association between the combination of coffee and tea and the risk of stroke, dementia, and poststroke dementia. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations of coffee and tea separately and in combination with the risk of developing stroke and dementia. This prospective cohort study included 365,682 participants (50 to 74 years old) from the UK Biobank. Participants joined the study from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up until 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations between coffee/tea consumption and incident stroke and dementia, adjusting for sex, age, ethnicity, qualification, income, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, alcohol status, smoking status, diet pattern, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), history of cancer, history of diabetes, history of cardiovascular arterial disease (CAD), and hypertension. Coffee and tea consumption was assessed at baseline. During a median follow-up of 11.4 years for new onset disease, 5,079 participants developed dementia, and 10,053 participants developed stroke. The associations of coffee and tea with stroke and dementia were nonlinear (P for nonlinear <0.01), and coffee intake of 2 to 3 cups/d or tea intake of 3 to 5 cups/d or their combination intake of 4 to 6 cups/d were linked with the lowest hazard ratio (HR) of incident stroke and dementia. Compared with those who did not drink tea and coffee, drinking 2 to 3 cups of coffee and 2 to 3 cups of tea per day was associated with a 32% (HR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.79; P < 0.001) lower risk of stroke and a 28% (HR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P = 0.002) lower risk of dementia. Moreover, the combination of coffee and tea consumption was associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke and vascular dementia. Additionally, the combination of tea and coffee was associated with a lower risk of poststroke dementia, with the lowest risk of incident poststroke dementia at a daily consumption level of 3 to 6 cups of coffee and tea (HR, 0.52, 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.83; P = 0.007). The main limitations were that coffee and tea intake was self-reported at baseline and may not reflect long-term consumption patterns, unmeasured confounders in observational studies may result in biased effect estimates, and UK Biobank participants are not representative of the whole United Kingdom population. We found that drinking coffee and tea separately or in combination were associated with lower risk of stroke and dementia.

This study aims to assess knowledge, perception, and attitudes towards biomedical research and biobanking among students at the University of Jordan. An online questionnaire was designed, developed, and piloted. It was divided into 5 sections that included questions related to issues of biomedical research and biobanking as well as factors influencing the decision to participate. Responses from 435 students revealed that 52.9% previously heard of biobanks. There was an overwhelming acceptance for participation in biomedical, genetic, and biobanking research. A blood sample was the most preferred for donation. Protection of privacy, informed consent prior to donation, approval of an ethics committee, and trust towards researchers were the most important factors associated with willingness to participate. On the other hand, the vagueness of the type of research performed on the biospecimens and the unavailability of general research results to the donor had a negative connotation. There was no clear agreement on the type of informed consent preferred by students, but to be contacted and informed of research results was preferred by the majority. Students also preferred the disposal of biospecimens and information when deciding to withdraw from participation.

179,What Do Biomedical Researchers Want from Biobanks? Results of an Online Survey.,"Amanda Rush,Daniel R Catchpoole,Georget Reaiche-Miller,Thomas Gilbert,Wayne Ng,Peter Hamilton Watson,Jennifer A Byrne",,,,,2021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34756100/,"The purpose of biobanking is to provide biospecimens and associated data to researchers, yet the perspectives of biobank research users have been under-investigated. This study aimed to ascertain biobank research users' needs and opinions about biobanking services.  An online survey was developed, which requested information about researcher demographics, localities of biobanks accessed, methods of sourcing biospecimens, and opinions on topics including but not limited to, application processes, data availability, access fees, and return of research results. There were 27 multiple choice/check box questions, 4 questions with a 10-point Likert scale, and 8 questions with provision for further comment. A web link for the survey was distributed to researchers in late 2019/early 2020 in four Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia.  Respondents were generally satisfied with biobank application processes and the fit for purpose of received biospecimens/data. Nonetheless, most researchers ( = 61/99, 62%) reported creating their own collections owing to gaps in sample availability and a perceived increase in efficiency. Most accessed biobanks ( = 58/74, 78%) were in close proximity (local or intrastate) to the researcher. Most researchers had limited the scope of their research owing to difficulty of obtaining biospecimens ( = 55/86, 64%) and/or data ( = 52/85, 60%), with the top three responses for additional types of data required being  more long term follow up data,   more clinical data,  and  more linked government data.  The top influence to use a particular biobank was cost, and the most frequently suggested improvement was reduced direct  cost of obtaining biospecimens.   Biobanks that do not meet the needs of their end-users are unlikely to be optimally utilized or sustainable. This survey provides valuable insights to guide biobanks and other stakeholders, such as developing marketing and client engagement plans to encourage local research users and discouraging the creation of unnecessary new collections.",,,Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Research Personnel;Surveys and Questionnaires;biobank;business planning;market research;researcher;stakeholders;sustainability;

We investigated the association between hypertension/elevated BP and AD in 2 cohorts and conducted a meta-analysis of published prospective studies, including these 2 studies. We analyzed data from the J-SHC study (Japan-Specific Health Checkups) and UK Biobank, which prospectively followed up 534 378 and 502 424 participants, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the association of hypertension/elevated BP with AD incidence in the UK Biobank and AD mortality in the J-SHC Study. In the meta-analysis, summary relative risks were calculated with random-effects models. A potential nonlinear dose-response relationship between BP and AD was tested with fractional polynomial models, and the best-fitting second-order fractional polynomial regression model was determined. In the J-SHC study and UK Biobank, there were 84 and 182 ADs during the 4- and 9-year follow-up, and the adjusted hazard ratios of AD were 3.57 (95% CI, 2.17-6.11) and 2.68 (95% CI, 1.78-4.04) in hypertensive individuals, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.68) and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.11-1.48) per 20-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (SBP), and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.40-2.00) and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.46-1.89) per 10-mm Hg increase in diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. In the meta-analysis, the summary relative risks were 3.07 (95% CI, 2.15-4.38, =76.7%, n=7 studies, 2818 ADs, 4 563 501 participants) for hypertension and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.16-1.66, =47.7%, n=3) and 1.79 (95% CI: 1.51-2.12,  = 57.0%, n=3) per 20-mm Hg increase in SBP and per 10-mm Hg increase in DBP, respectively. The AD risk showed a strong, positive dose-response relationship with SBP and even more so with DBP. The risk of AD in the nonlinear dose-response analysis was significant at SBP >132 mm Hg and DBP >75 mm Hg. Hypertension and elevated SBP and DBP are associated with a high risk of AD. The risk of AD was positively dose dependent, even within the normal BP range. These findings provide further evidence for the optimization of BP to prevent AD.",,,"Aortic Dissection;Biological Specimen Banks;Blood Pressure;Humans;Hypertension;Japan;Risk Factors;United Kingdom;aneurysm, dissecting;blood pressure;cohort studies;dose-response relationship, drug;hypertension;meta-analysis"

We investigated whether visual impairment is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia in UK Biobank and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). In both cohorts, visual acuity was measured using a  logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution  (LogMAR) chart and categorized as no (≤0.30 LogMAR), mild (>0.3 to ≤0.50 LogMAR), and moderate to severe (>0.50 LogMAR) impairment. Dementia was ascertained through linkage to electronic medical records. After restricting to those aged ≥60 years, without prevalent dementia and with eye measures available, the analytic samples consisted of 62 206 UK Biobank and 7 337 EPIC-Norfolk participants, respectively. In UK Biobank and EPIC-Norfolk, respectively, 1 113 and 517 participants developed dementia over 11 and 15 years of follow-up.

We assessed patient awareness, perception and choices among rheumatology outpatients regarding aging biobanking activities. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients, aged 50 or older, attending an outpatient rheumatology tertiary department. Demographic data and perceptions about biobanking were collected and statistical analysis was performed. 132 valid questionnaires were obtained (mean age: 63,4; 68,2% female; mean education years: 8,35). 61,7% of respondents did not know the specific term  biobank , 57,7% knew they could donate biological material for BBR, 89,9% agreed with these infrastructures and 88,3% would consider participation Those participants with more years of education were more knowledgeable and prone to biobank participation. Willingness to participate in BBR was mainly related (86,4%) to the advancement of scientific knowledge and not individual gain. Scientific research institutes were indicated as the most adequate institutions to manage BBR. Informed consent, anonymity and confidentiality ranked as top requisites for biobank participation. 61,3% of respondents expressed their agreement with aging biobanks, considering these as a sign of respect for specific problems of people of older ages such as higher disease burdens.

Although biobanks have different modes of operation, all face a variety of similar challenges. Some of these challenges, such as donor consent and privacy, have been rigorously debated, but comparatively less attention has been paid to biobanks' intellectual property (IP) practices. IP rights (particularly patents) are integral to the translation of research into clinically relevant outcomes and, therefore, are key features in the business models of many biobanks. As a foundation for such research, commentators have identified five IP clauses of interest: (i) non-obstruction clauses; (ii) march-in clauses; (iii) grant-back clauses; (iv) return-of-results clauses and (v) reach-through clauses (also commonly called `reach-through rights'). In the limited literature that discusses the five clauses, commentators have largely debated their advantages and disadvantages in the abstract. The IP terms that biobanks  use have not been empirically examined, apart from some small case studies. In particular, no industry-wide evidence exists on three points of biobanks' IP practice: (i) if and how biobanks implement these five types of IP clauses, (ii) whether any norms or standards have emerged, and (iii) whether the norms and standards align with commentators' recommendations for using the five IP clauses. To address these three gaps, the authors conducted a systematic, global survey of the IP clauses used by large, human biobanks. The results indicate that biobanks draft bespoke policies to meet their own needs, and probably do so without knowledge of the gamut of IP terms available. This study also revealed that, in general, biobanks are using IP terms differently from the advice of the commentators. On reviewing the differences, we encourage the use of march-in and grant-back clauses, discourage biobanks from using redundant non-obstruction clauses, and call for more research on return-of-results clauses. We also encourage the use of reach-through clauses to claim royalties (not IP), but only in limited circumstances; for example, where user access fees do not cover a biobanks' operational costs.",,,biobanks;grant-back;intellectual property;licensing;march-in;reach-through;

Information is lacking regarding hemolysis for biobank samples. There is a need for a method that can easily measure hemoglobin as an indicator of hemolysis in stored samples before they are included in research projects. In this study we present a simple method for estimating hemolysis and investigate the effect of centrifugation speeds and temperatures on sample turbidity that commonly interferes with measurements.  Using a variation of the Beer-Lambert law, we quantified the hemoglobin concentration in 75 long-term stored samples at a wavelength of 414 nm with a NanoDrop™ 8000 spectrophotometer. Owing to interference from turbidity, the samples underwent different treatments post-thawing: centrifugation at 10,000 and 20,000  at two different temperatures (4°C and 19°C) for 15 minutes. In addition, freshly collected serum samples ( = 20) underwent a single freeze-thaw cycle, with hemoglobin measured prefreeze, post-thaw, and postcentrifugation. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test groups and pairwise Wilcoxon rank test were used for statistical analysis.  A strong effect of centrifugation on the turbidity was shown for the long-term stored samples, however, this effect was independent of the temperature or centrifugation speeds. Centrifugation at 20,000  for 15 minutes at 19°C reduced the turbidity up to 50%. A single freeze-thaw cycle in the fresh samples increased the optical density at 414 nm slightly, indicating a false increase of hemoglobin concentration. The following centrifugation reduced the concentration to less than the initial sample measurements, suggesting the presence of interference immediately after sampling.  We describe here a simple and cost-effective NanoDrop-based method for measuring hemolysis levels intended for use in biobank facilities. We found that centrifugation, but not temperature, is a crucial step to reduce interference from turbidity.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Centrifugation;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Freezing;Hemolysis;Humans;biobank;hemolysis;serum;spectrophotometric method;turbidity;

There are several potential data sources that might be expected to provide biobank numbers, such as institutions, research funders, and literature databases (e.g., PubMed), but in practice this information is rarely available and is hard to find. However, the maturation of several online health research biobank locators (also known as directories and catalogs) that relate to 12 countries and/or states has now provided some initial data to address the question of how many health research biobanks exist in relation to population size.  We have analyzed four biobank locators: the Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium directory, the Canadian Tissue Repository Network locator, the Australian New South Wales Australia Health Pathology locator, and the UK Clinical Research Collaboration Tissue Directory.  We conclude that across these locators, and in those regions with potential for high research capacity as indicated by comparable gross domestic products, there are 11-30 health research biobanks/million population (2 large biobanks with >1000 samples and a further 9-28 are medium-small biobanks).

COVID-19 outcomes were derived from Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data, hospital admissions data, and death certificates (until 18 August 2020). Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between smoking status and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses using established genetic instruments for smoking initiation and smoking heaviness were undertaken (reported per SD increase). There were 421 469 eligible participants, 1649 confirmed infections, 968 COVID-19-related hospitalisations and 444 COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with never-smokers, current smokers had higher risks of hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and mortality (smoking 1-9/day: OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24; 10-19/day: OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.66 to 9.54; 20+/day: OR 6.11, 95% CI 3.59 to 10.42).

We assessed the relationship between ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation among participants in Taiwan Biobank (TWB) based on the rs2860905 variant of the cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily C Member 9 (CYP2C9) gene. Using logistic regression analysis, we estimated the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ischemic stroke among 17,726 biobank adults recruited from 2008 through 2015. Of the eligible participants (n = 17,726), 906 were identified with ischemic stroke. Atrial fibrillation was positively associated with ischemic stroke (OR=3.70; 95% CI, 2.21-6.20), whereas the rs2860905 variant was not. The OR for ischemic stroke among those with GA/AA genotype was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.82-1.22) compared to those with the GG genotype. Based on the genotype-stratified analysis, the OR for ischemic stroke was 4.68 (95% CI, 2.70-8.09) among individuals with GG genotype who had atrial fibrillation compared to those who did not. These results demonstrate that the GG genotype of the CYP2C9 rs2860905 variant appears to enhance the risk of ischemic stroke among adults in Taiwan.

The necessity to find new ways to manage biobanks has been clearly recognized and one way to do this is to follow the success of some commercial direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) companies in the biobanking field. This paper is focused on a double role the return of individual health related findings (IHRF) detected through the biobanking activities can play in the management of biobanks. These findings can be seen as an untapped opportunity to offer health related information to biobank participants. At the same time, the IHRF policy can also serve as an additional tool that can improve biobanking governance. This paper aims to consider diverse IHRF approaches as well as to explore some key ethical concerns related to them. In particular, it reveals how different accounts of personal autonomy shape consent policies related to IHRF and emphasizes ethical controversies related to the commercial DTC GT initiatives as well as some non-profit biobanks.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Europe;Humans;Motivation;Personal Autonomy;Consent;Direct-to-consumer genetic testing;Ethical issues;Non-profit biobanking;Return of individual health related findings;

We determined the prevalence of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in the UK Biobank and standardized the results to the UK general population. This cross-sectional study analyzed baseline UK Biobank data on plasma glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to compare the prevalence of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in white, South Asian, black, and Chinese participants. The overall and ethnic-specific results were standardized to the UK general population aged 40-70 years of age. Within the UK Biobank, the overall crude prevalence was 3.6% for pre-diabetes, 0.8% for undiagnosed diabetes, and 4.4% for either. Following standardization to the UK general population, the results were similar at 3.8%, 0.8%, and 4.7%, respectively. Crude prevalence was much higher in South Asian (11.0% pre-diabetes; 3.6% undiagnosed diabetes; 14.6% either) or black (13.8% pre-diabetes; 3.0% undiagnosed diabetes; 16.8% either) participants. Only six middle-aged or old-aged South Asian individuals or seven black would need to be tested to identify an HbA1c result that merits action. Single-stage population screening for pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes in middle-old or old-aged South Asian and black individuals using HbA1c could be efficient and should be considered.",,,Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diabetes Mellitus;Ethnicity;Glycated Hemoglobin;Humans;Middle Aged;Prediabetic State;Prevalence;United Kingdom;diabetes mellitus;early diagnosis;ethnic groups;glycated hemoglobin A;type 2;

Adolescents (14-18 years) in public schools and their parents were invited to participate in a survey either with or without viewing educational material about biobanking before completing the survey. Questions included willingness to donate, consenting practices and use of specimens. Surveys were administered. Nonparametric statistical tests (Mann-Whitney ) were used to test the significance of differences in Likert scale responses between participant groups. A total of 545 participants (219 adolescent and 176 parents with prior awareness about biobanking vs. 106 adolescents and 44 parents without) completed the survey. Participants who had participated in an educational session were more willing to donate compared to participants without this session under three different conditions: a left-over sample, an extra sample at the time of a medical procedure, and an extra procedure. Adolescents without prior awareness were significantly more willing to donate compared to their parents. Parents perceived the need for reconsent more important than children, although it was less important to educated parents versus noneducated parents. Age of assent was lower in the groups with prior awareness and ongoing use of specimens without reconsent was more permissible to these participants.

198,A scoping review of considerations and practices for benefit sharing in biobanking.,"Allan Sudoi,Jantina De Vries,Dorcas Kamuya",,,,,2021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34315443/," Despite the rapid global growth of biobanking over the last few decades, and their potential for the advancement of health research, considerations specific to the sharing of benefits that accrue from biobanks have received little attention. Questions such as the types and range of benefits that can arise in biobanking, who should be entitled to those benefits, when they should be provided, by whom and in what form remain mostly unanswered. We conducted a scoping review to describe benefit sharing considerations and practices in biobanking in order to inform current and future policy and practice. Drawing on the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a scoping review of the literature in three online databases (PubMed, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar). We extracted and charted data to capture general characteristics, definitions and examples of benefits and benefit sharing, justification for benefit sharing, challenges in benefit sharing, governance mechanisms as well as proposed benefit sharing mechanisms. 29 articles published between 1999 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria for the study. The articles included 5 empirical and 24 non-empirical studies. Only 12 articles discussed benefit sharing as a stand-alone subject, while the remaining 17 integrated a discussion of benefits as one issue amongst others. Major benefit sharing challenges in biobanking were found to be those associated with uncertainties around the future use of samples and in resultant benefits. Most of the benefit sharing definitions and approaches currently in use for biobanking are similar to those used in health research. These approaches may not recognise the distinct features of biobanking, specifically relating to uncertainties associated with the sharing and re-use of samples. We therefore support approaches that allow decisions about benefit sharing to be made progressively once it is apparent who samples are to be shared with, the intended purpose and expected benefits. We also highlight gaps in key areas informing benefit sharing in biobanking and draw attention to the need for further empirical research.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Empirical Research;Humans;Benefit sharing;Benefits;Biobanking;Biobanks;Ethics;Sample sharing;

Federal regulations governing research in the United States provide minimal guidance and allow for a range of practices, including waiving the requirement to obtain reconsent. Some commentators have argued that institutional review boards should indeed grant such waivers, given the low risks of biobank-based research and the impracticality of contacting all participants when they turn 18. There is also significant ethical debate about the age at which adolescents can make authentic, autonomous decisions regarding their research participation.

This project can be considered as the biggest and most comprehensive cohort study in Malaysia, where hundreds of thousands of human samples are stored for epidemiological and biomedical research. However, little is known about the current issues or the situation related to biobank research in Malaysia. There are pressing issues that need answers such as the governance of the national biobank as well as other privately owned biobanks in the nation, the public perspectives and perceptions regarding biobanks, and other matters such as the ethical, legal, and social issues related to biobank research. This article will highlight the status and issues related to biobank research in Malaysia and provide suggestions on future research practices that we feel need to be seriously considered. These suggestions are designed to advance and enlighten researchers' knowledge, as well as provide the public with information on issues associated to biobanking. Good governance increases public knowledge and trust, and religious acceptance of biobank research and accountability can lead to increased participation in biobank research.

As yet, to the author's knowledge, there has been no study conducted to examine whether these conditions could result in the commercialization of biomaterials and data and whether such practice is considered ethical. This paper therefore seeks to answer the question of whether such sharing of biomaterials and data for biobank research in exchange for funding from sponsors and funders in collaborative health research is ethically justified. The central idea of this paper is based on an argument against commodification of the body and its parts, which includes biomaterials and data and holds that it is ethically wrong to commodify humans and their body parts. The arguments against commodification of biomaterials and data explored are the Kantian approach argument as it relates to interference of commodification with human dignity which is linked to a diminished sense of personhood, an argument against commodification that is based on a dilution of altruism and lastly the communitarian approach anti-commodification argument which emphasizes a social responsibility to the common good.

First, we decided on the important constructs for a questionnaire followed by development of an item pool through review of the scientific literature and published questionnaires. The questionnaire was refined through cognitive interviews and translation. An expert panel assessed content validity. The final questionnaire included five domains: perceptions; aspects important to participation in biobank research; preferences for type of biobank; attitudes toward biobanking; and willingness to participate in biobank research. Second, we distributed the questionnaire to 250 members of the public from Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, and Morocco to assess the questionnaire's psychometric properties, including reliability (internal consistency and Cronbach's alpha) and construct validity (convergent and divergent validity and exploratory factor analysis [EFA]).  Internal consistency yielded a range of Cronbach's alpha for the five domains from 0.62 to 0.80. EFA showed a 12-factorial solution. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.907 and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant ( < 0.005). Attitudes were positively correlated with willingness to donate ( = 0.30;  < 0.001).  The final biobank Arabic language questionnaire showed excellent reliability and acceptable validity parameters.

However, biobanks need to accept the reality of a life cycle for RIs. Until recently, strategies to sustain biobanks have been commonly focused on ways to maintain current operational models. However, sustaining biobanks as they exist today may be increasingly challenging in the face of the disruption in health and research priorities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this opinion article, we review the current and emerging future drivers of biobank value for their researchers, institutions, and funders, highlighting utilization and impact of research performed using the biobank as key measures of future value. While biobanks can only indirectly influence the specific impact of the research performed, they can transform themselves to more actively redefine utilization to their advantage. Utilization means more than the balance of samples and data in versus out. Utilization means redirecting expertise to best support end users, and importantly, closing the operating gap between biobanks and their end users who seek to find the right biospecimens and data to pursue their research. We discuss the specific role of locators (those created by public investment) in closing this gap and the need for additional tools for researchers, before and subsequent to connecting with locators. For the former, we specifically propose that more support is needed to assist researchers in the decision as to how to best obtain biospecimens and navigate the options as to whether finding existing biospecimens and data held by a biobank is the optimal solution for a given project, or whether the optimal solution is either contracting with a biobank to collect samples or creating a new biobank.

However, these opportunities to advance medical science are fraught with challenges including ethical and legal dilemmas. This study was undertaken to establish perspectives of South African stakeholders on the ethico-legal dimensions of biobanking. An in-depth exploratory study was conducted with 25 purposively selected biobankers, clinicians, researchers, postgraduate students in biobanking research, and research ethics committee (REC) members in South Africa. Potential study participants were recruited through known hubs for biobanking in the country, online searches and the snowball sampling technique. A semi-structured face-to-face or Skype interview was arranged. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. The emergent themes included: inconsistency in understanding consent models, disconnect between biobank researchers and biosample donors, inadequate processes to support re-consenting minors, inconsistent governance processes for biobanking research; challenges with sample and data sharing, and suboptimal strategies for benefit sharing and return of results. Biobanking practice in general appeared to be inconsistent and fragmented. While the need for consent in research is explicitly outlined in legislative documents, some respondents were unclear on the type of consent model to apply in biosample collection. They also reported inconsistencies in research participants' understanding of consent. Furthermore, these respondents' own understanding of consent and consent models were dependent on where they were positioned in biobanking practice (roles occupied). Respondents were unsure about the process to follow to re-consent child participants once the age of majority (≥ 18 years) was reached. It was not surprising that consent was identified as one of the major ethical challenges in biobanking practice. In certain settings, some respondents reported suboptimal governance processes for sample collection. Participants were generally unsure about how to operationalise benefit sharing and how to approach the idea of returning results to research participants and biobank donors. The study findings indicated inconsistencies in stakeholder understanding of ethico-legal considerations related to biobanking in South Africa. A need for ongoing ethics capacity development among stakeholders was identified. Improving understanding of the ethics of biobanking could be facilitated by acknowledging the disconnect created by biosamples in the relationship between biobank researchers and donors.",,,"Adolescent;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Child;Ethics Committees, Research;Humans;Informed Consent;South Africa;Biobanking;Biobanks;Biorepositories;Ethics;Stakeholders"

Automating these processes requires highly efficient and scalable methods and software, but so far there is no workflow solution to easily process 1 million GWAS samples. Here we present BIGwas, a portable, fully automated quality control and association testing pipeline for large-scale binary and quantitative trait GWAS data provided by biobank resources. By using Nextflow workflow and Singularity software container technology, BIGwas performs resource-efficient and reproducible analyses on a local computer or any high-performance compute (HPC) system with just 1 command, with no need to manually install a software execution environment or various software packages. For a single-command GWAS analysis with 974,818 individuals and 92 million genetic markers, BIGwas takes ∼16 days on a small HPC system with only 7 compute nodes to perform a complete GWAS QC and association analysis protocol. Our dynamic parallelization approach enables shorter runtimes for large HPCs. Researchers without extensive bioinformatics knowledge and with few computer resources can use BIGwas to perform multi-cohort GWAS with 1 million GWAS samples and, if desired, use it to build their own (genome-wide) PheWAS resource.

The discipline of biobanking has existed for over 20 years and is supported by several international professional societies and dedicated academic journals. However, despite both rising research demand for human biospecimens, and the growth of biobanking as an academic discipline, many individual biobanks continue to experience sustainability challenges. This commentary will summarize how the COVID-19 pandemic is creating new challenges and opportunities for both the health biobanking sector and the supporting discipline of biobanking. While the challenges for biobanks may be numerous and acute, there are opportunities for both individual biobanks and the discipline of biobanking to embrace change such that biobanks can continue to support and drive biomedical research. We will therefore describe numerous practical steps that individual biobanks and/or the discipline of biobanking can take to survive and possibly thrive in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,COVID-19;biobanking;health biobank;infrastructure;research support;sustainability;
214,Vignettes to Illustrate the Value of Tumor Biobanks in Cancer Research in Canada.,"Tamsin Tarling,Lise Anne Marie Matzke,Amanda Rush,Brent Gali,Jennifer A Byrne,Peter H Watson",,,,,2021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34165356/,"Tumor biobanks are a common research infrastructure. As a collection of biospecimens and annotated data collected to support a multitude of research projects, biobanks facilitate access to materials that are the critical fuel for the generation of data in up to 40% of cancer research publications. However, quantifying how to measure biobanks' impact and their value on the field of cancer research discoveries and findings, has not been well elucidated.  We have used a qualitative case study approach to illustrate the impact of tumor biobanks. We assessed the impact of three research studies published between 2010 and 2012 that required easily accessible  classic  biobanks. Each study utilized preassembled collections of tumor biospecimens with associated patient outcomes data at the outset of the research project. We compared the resulting journal impact factor, altmetric and field-weighted citation impact factor scores for each article to a set of six  benchmark  articles that represent cancer research and treatment discoveries from the same time period and two sentinel scientific discovery articles.  We developed a value model using a literature search and design-thinking methodologies to illustrate the contributions of these  classic  model biobanks to these research studies. Assessment of the three example articles supported by biobanks demonstrates that the output can have impact that is comparable to the impact of a set of benchmark articles describing milestones in the field of cancer research and cancer care.  These case studies illustrate the value of the sustained investment of funds, planning, time, and effort on the part of the biobanks before the conduct of the research study to be able to ultimately support high-value research. The  value  model will enable further discussion around impact and may be useful in better delineating qualitative metrics of biobank value in the future.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Canada;Humans;Neoplasms;Publications;biobanking;biobanks;cancer;impact;research;value;

The variety of collections combining biological samples and medical scientific information makes biobanking an indispensable tool in the development of modern medicine. In 2016, Poland, a country with one of the largest populations in Europe, joined the Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC) to facilitate access to quality-defined human disease-relevant biological resources. This push led to the development of the Polish Biobanking Network. The purpose of this paper is to present the current state of biobanks in Poland in the context of their location, nature and resources. To obtain information about and overall characteristics of Polish entities dealing with biobanking biological material, the dedicated Information Survey was designed. The survey was prepared in an electronic form and consisted of 53 questions-both open and closed, single and multiple choice-with some questions depending on each other. Sixty-five Polish biobanks/biorepositories participated in the survey. Polish biobanks are mostly affiliated with research entities (universities-42% and research institutes-30%). The data collected indicate that a considerable number of Polish biobanks are specialized (33 units), in contrast to population-based biobanks (8 units). These biobanks are mostly focused on collecting samples from oncological (23 biobanks) and rare diseases (12 biobanks). In general, great diversity was found in the material collected. Scientists working in Polish biobanks are very open to scientific cooperation (declared by 60% of units) and sharing their collections with the international scientific environment. In terms of quality issues, most biobanks declared that their quality management system was in the process of implementation (45%) or had already been implemented (23%). Although biobanking in Poland is still in its infancy, the results of this study seem promising and may be valuable to the wider biobanking research community. The distribution of biobanks throughout the Polish territory, their connection with scientific and clinical units, and their involvement in research on rare diseases may contribute to an increase in the number of multicenter studies.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Europe;Humans;Poland;BBMRI.pl;Biobank;Biorepository;Biospecimen;Human samples;Poland;Polish Biobanking Network;Research;

The national supervising authority has emphasized the centrality of providing children with age-appropriate information. We analyzed one such campaign. We argue that by simplifying the complex socio-technical arrangements of biobanking with the introduction of a new metaphor-like concept,  Bio-me,  the campaign presents a misleading and reductionist picture of data-driven biomedicine and biobank participation. First, the Bio-me character seems to bear similarities to the seventeenth-century explanations of embryological development. Second, the focus in the campaign is on biological material while crucial connections to different sorts of data are ignored. Third, we point to the absence of verbal references to genes and DNA, although the prevailing visualization comprises the double helix.

Here, we assessed the effect modification of physical activity, oily fish and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake with APOE genotype on risk of incident CAD. The present study comprised 345,659 white European participants from UK Biobank (mean age: 56.5 years, 45.7% men) without a history of CAD. Information regarding physical activity, oily fish intake and PUFA intake was collected through questionnaires, and information on incident CAD through linkage with hospital admission records. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex. Higher physical activity level and oily fish intake were both associated with a lower incidence of CAD. However, these associations were similar across the different APOE genotypes (p-values for interaction > 0.05). Most notable, higher PUFA intake was associated with a lower CAD risk in APOE ε4 genotype carriers (hazard ratio: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.92), and not in APOE ε3/ε3 genotype carriers (0.90; 0.79, 1.02), but without statistical evidence for effect modification (p-value = 0.137). While higher physical activity and high fish and PUFA intake were associated with a lower risk of incident CAD, no evidence for interaction of these lifestyle factors with APOE genotype was observed in UK Biobank participants.

219,Can Blockchain Solve the Dilemma in the Ethics of Genomic Biobanks?,"Valérie Racine",,,,,2021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34061257/,"In discussions on the ethics of genome collections and biobanks, the main worry about whether we are permitted to collect and use individuals' genomic and genetic data is the potential for the violation of individuals' right to informational privacy. Yet, if we do not permit these endeavors, we risk giving up on the future benefits of biomedical research. In this paper, I describe a private venture in blockchain genomics that seeks to provide an apt solution to concerns about potential privacy violations in genome collections and biobanks. I then provide some reasons to doubt the kind of solution to the dilemma that such start-ups propose. I argue that the sort of autonomy that grounds the value of the right to informational privacy cannot be secured with blockchain technology alone. So, blockchain genomics ventures are insufficient to establish the permissibility of genome collections and biobanks. I then discuss an additional ethical challenge to genomic biobanks. This challenge takes the form of doubting that future benefits that result from biomedical research dependent on genomic databases will outweigh the costs. Despite criticisms of genomic research, I claim that it is reasonable to think that future net benefits will be gained from research on such databases. Therefore, I conclude that there remains a dilemma in the ethics of genomic biobanks.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Blockchain;Databases, Factual;Genomics;Humans;Privacy;Autonomy;Biobanks;Blockchain;Genome collections;Informational privacy"

221,Recommendations for a Dutch Sustainable Biobanking Environment.,"Rogier van der Stijl,Peggy Manders,Elisabeth W H M Eijdems",,,,,2021,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34042498/,"Biobanks and their collections are considered essential for contemporary biomedical research and a critical resource toward personalized medicine. However, they need to operate in a sustainable manner to prevent research waste and maximize impact. Sustainability is the capacity of a biobank to remain operative, effective, and competitive over its expected lifetime. This remains a challenge given a biobank's position at the interplay of ethical, societal, scientific, and commercial values and the difficulties in finding continuous funding. In the end, biobanks are responsible for their own sustainability. Still, biobanks also depend on their surrounding environment, which contains overarching legislative, policy, financial, and other factors that can either impede or promote sustainability. The Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure for The Netherlands (BBMRI.nl) has worked on improving the national environment for sustainable biobanking. In this article, we present the final outcomes of this BBMRI.nl project. First, we summarize the current overarching challenges of the Dutch biobanking landscape. These challenges were gathered during workshops and focus groups with Dutch biobanks and their users, for which the full results are described in separate reports. The main overarching challenges relate to sample and data quality, funding, use and reuse, findability and accessibility, and the general image of biobanks. Second, we propose a package of recommendations-across nine themes-toward creating overarching conditions that stimulate and enable sustainable biobanking. These recommendations serve as a guideline for the Dutch biobanking community and their stakeholders to jointly work toward practical implementation and a better biobanking environment. There are undoubtedly parallels between the Dutch situation and the challenges found in other countries. We hope that sharing our project's approach, outcomes, and recommendations will support other countries in their efforts toward sustainable biobanking.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Delivery of Health Care;Netherlands;Precision Medicine;biobank;macro-environment;overarching challenges;policy recommendations;sustainability;

After a decade of rolling out such infrastructures, a shift in attention to the sustainability of biobanks could be observed in recent years. In this regard, an increase in the as yet relatively low utilisation rates of biobanks has been formulated as a goal. Higher utilisation rates can only be achieved if the perspectives of potential users of biobanks-particularly researchers not yet collaborating with biobanks-are adequately considered. To better understand their perspectives, a survey was conducted at ten different research institutions in Germany hosting a centralised biobank. The survey targeted potential users of biobank services, i.e. researchers working with biosamples. It addressed the general demand for biosamples, strategies for biosample acquisition/storage and reasons for/against collaborating with biobanks. In total, 354 researchers filled out the survey. Most interestingly, only a minority of researchers (12%) acquired their biosamples via biobanks. Of the respondents not collaborating with biobanks on sample acquisition, around half were not aware of the (services of the) respective local biobank. Those who actively decided against acquiring biosamples via a biobank provided different reasons. Most commonly, respondents stated that the biosamples required were not available, the costs were too high and information about the available biosamples was not readily accessible. Biobanks can draw many lessons from the results of the survey. Particularly, external communication and outreach should be improved. Additionally, biobanks might have to reassess whether their particular collection strategies are adequately aligned with local researchers' needs.",,,Humans;Biological Specimen Banks;Stakeholder Participation;Germany;Biomedical Research;Surveys and Questionnaires;

However, the over-representation of Europeans in genomic studies not only limits the global understanding of disease risk but also inhibits viable research into the genomic differences between carriers and patients. Whilst the community has agreed that more diverse samples are required, it is not enough to blindly increase diversity; the diversity must be quantified, compared and annotated to lead to insight. Genetic annotations from separate biobanks need to be comparable and computable and to operate without access to raw data due to privacy concerns. Comparability is key both for regular research and to allow international comparison in response to pandemics. Here, we evaluate the appropriateness of the most common genomic tools used to depict population structure in a standardized and comparable manner. The end goal is to reduce the effects of confounding and learn from genuine variation in genetic effects on phenotypes across populations, which will improve the value of biobanks (locally and internationally), increase the accuracy of association analyses and inform developmental efforts.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Genetics, Population;Humans;Pandemics;Privacy;Biobanks;Bioinformatics;Genomic medicine;Population stratification bias;Population structure"

In the first year of implementation of the biobank, 117 patients (Female: 62; Male: 55) had 125 brain tumor surgeries. 75% of patients had tumors biobanked, and 16% were of minority race/ethnicity. Tumors biobanked were as follows: diffuse gliomas (45%), brain metastases (29%), meningioma (21%), and other (5%). Among biobanked patients, 100% also had next generation sequencing. Eleven patients qualified for targeted therapy based on identification of actionable gene mutations. One patient with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome was also identified. An iterative quality improvement process was implemented to streamline the workflow between the operating room, pathology, and the research laboratory. Dedicated tumor bank personnel in the department of neurosurgery greatly improved standard operating procedure. Intraoperative selection and processing of tumor tissue by the neurosurgeon was integral to increasing success with cell culture assays. Currently, our institutional protocol integrates standard histopathological diagnosis, next generation sequencing, and functional assays on surgical specimens to develop precision medicine protocols for our patients.

These challenges are exacerbated when the biobanking efforts aim to facilitate research on public health emergencies and include the sharing of samples and data between low/middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). In this article, we explore ethical challenges for COVID-19 biobanking, offering examples from two past infectious disease outbreaks in LMICs where biobanking activities contributed to the perpetuation of global inequities. We focus on how the ethical imperative to promote the common good during public health emergencies can conflict with protecting the interests of biobank participants. We discuss how conducting biobank research under a waiver of informed consent during public health emergencies is ethically permissible, provided guidance is in place to prevent biopiracy and exploitation of vulnerable communities. We also highlight the need for biobank collaborations between LMICs and HICs to promote capacity building and benefit sharing. Finally, we offer guidance to promote the ethical oversight of biobanks and biobank research during the COVID-19 pandemic or other future public health emergencies.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;COVID-19;Developing Countries;Emergencies;Ethics, Research;Humans;Pandemics;Public Health;ethics;human tissue;public health ethics;research ethics"

Weighted burden analysis of rare variants was applied to exome sequenced UK Biobank subjects with hyperlipidaemia as the phenotype, of whom 44 054 were designated cases and 156 578 controls, with the strength of association characterised by the signed log 10 p value (SLP).  With principal components included as covariates there was a tendency for genes on the X chromosome to produce strongly negative SLPs, and this was found to be due to the fact that rare X chromosome variants were identified less frequently in men than women. The test performed well when both principal components and sex were included as covariates and strongly implicated  (SLP=50.08) and  (SLP=-10.42) while also highlighting other genes previously found to be associated with lipid levels. Variants classified by SIFT as deleterious have on average a twofold effect and their cumulative frequency is such that they are present in approximately 1.5% of the population.  These analyses shed further light on the way that genetic variation contributes to risk of hyperlipidaemia and in particular that there are very many protein-altering variants which have on average moderate effects and whose effects can be detected when large samples of exome-sequenced subjects are available.

The authors sought to assess these interactions in the UK Biobank cohort of 500,000 participants. The authors assessed the effect of socioeconomic deprivation on education- and intelligence-associated genetic variants by estimating the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability for fluid intelligence, educational attainment, and years of education in subsets of UK Biobank participants with different degrees of social deprivation, using linkage disequilibrium score regression. They also generated polygenic scores with LDpred and tested for interactions with social deprivation. SNP heritability increased with socioeconomic deprivation for fluid intelligence, educational attainment, and years of education. Polygenic scores were also found to interact with socioeconomic deprivation, where the effects of the scores increased with increasing deprivation for all traits. These results indicate that genetics have a larger influence on educational and cognitive outcomes in more socioeconomically deprived U.K. citizens, which has serious implications for equality of opportunity.",,,"Adult;Aged;Educational Status;Female;Genotype;Humans;Intelligence;Male;Middle Aged;Multifactorial Inheritance;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Social Class;Socioeconomic Factors;United Kingdom;Education;Genetics/Genomics;Intelligence;Neuroscience;Socioeconomic Deprivation"

This paper explores how threats and risks are anticipated and acted on in biobanking, which builds research repositories for biomedical samples and data. Focusing on the biggest harmonisation cluster of biomedical research in Europe, BBMRI-ERIC, the paper analyses different logics of risk in the anticipatory discourse on biobanking. Based on document analysis, interviews with ELSI experts, and field research, three types of framing of risk are reconstructed: data security, privacy, and data misuse. The paper finds that these logics downplay the broader social and political context and reflects on the limits of the practices of anticipatory governance in biobanking. It argues that this regime of governance can make it difficult for biobanks to address possible future challenges, such as access to biomedical data by authorities, pressures for integrating biobank data with other type of personal data, or their use for profiling beyond medical purposes. To address potential controversies and societal implications related to the use of big data in health research and medicine, the paper suggests to expand the vocabulary and practices of anticipatory governance, in the biobanking community and beyond.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Computer Security;Europe;Humans;Risk Management;Anticipation;Big data;Biobanking;Biosecurity;Datafication of health;Risk;

To understand the educational needs of the technical personnel a web-based survey was sent to all national biobanks via established e-mail registers. In total, 79 biobank employees completed the survey, including 43 technicians. The majority of the participating technical personnel stated that they had worked in a biobank for less than three years and had never participated in an advanced training. Three-quarters of the technicians indicated that they were not able to understand English content instantly. Based on these results and the results of a workshop with 16 biobank technicians, 41 learning objectives were formulated. These learning objectives can be used as a basis for advanced training programs for technical personnel in biobanks. Setting up courses based on the identified learning objectives for this group of biobank staff could contribute to harmonization and sustainability of biospecimen quality.",,,advanced training;biobank education;biobank technician;learning objectives;

The aim of this study is to develop recommendations for the Egyptian human biobanking ethical guidelines, which take into consideration the specific cultural and legal framework in Egypt.  We searched the literature for available biobanking ethical guidelines. Six themes were the concern of search, namely; informed consent, data protection, return of results, sharing of samples and data, community engagement, and stakeholder engagement. If a document refers to another guideline, the new source is identified and the previous step is repeated.  Ten documents were identified, which were analyzed for the themes mentioned above. Guidelines and best practices were identified, and then compared with the published documents about ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) related to biomedical research in Egypt to reach best recommendations.  We have proposed, by way of recommendations, key characteristics that a national ethics framework in Egypt could have. On informed consent, the practice of broad consent may be harmonized among biobanks in Egypt. Clear policies on return of research results, training requirements and availability of genetic counseling could also be instituted through the national framework. Additionally, such a framework should facilitate community and stakeholders engagement, which is important to secure trust and build consensus on contentious issues arising from sample and data sharing across borders and commercialization, among other concerns.",,,Biobanking;Egypt;Ethical guidelines;Informed consent;data sharing;

The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions and attitude of Egyptian physicians towards ethical issues in biobanking. A cross-sectional online survey was designed and distributed with the target group between November 2019 and January 2020. The questionnaire was completed by 223 physicians. While 65.5% reported hearing the term  Biobanking  before, 45.7% knew that there are biobanks in Egypt. Participants had a general positive attitude towards the value of biobanks in research. About 73% agreed that biobanks can share biospecimens with international research organizations, but only 42.6% supported collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, and 44% agreed to the use of user fees by biobanks. About 48% supported the use of broad consent in biobanks, and 73.1% believed that donors of biospecimens should be informed about results of research performed on their biospecimens. Although many Egyptian physicians heard about biobanking, they had limited knowledge about the existence of biobanks in Egypt.

We conducted the screening for a hypothetic problem in various European and American pediatric biobanks based on online surveys through e-mail distribution based on the Biobank Economic Modeling Tool (BEMT) questionnaire model. Participants in the survey had work experience in biobanking for at least 3 years or more. Contact information about the survey participants was confirmed on the social networks profiles (LinkedIn), as well as on generally available websites. First, we tried creating a model which can show the pediatric preclinical and basic clinical phase relationship and demonstrate how pediatric biobanking is linked to this process. Furthermore, we tried to look for new trends, and the final goal is to put the acquired knowledge into practice, so medical experts and patients could gain usable benefit from it. We concluded that leading positions must take into account ethical and legal aspects when considering the decision to include children in the biobank collection. However, communication with parents and children is essential. The biobank characteristics influence the biobank's motives to include children in the consent procedure.

We tested the hypothesis that a causal relationship exists between systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a generalized summary Mendelian randomization (GSMR) analysis using summary statistics of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 299,024 individuals of SBP or DBP as exposure variables against three different outcomes: 1) AD diagnosis (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project), 2) maternal family history of AD (UK Biobank), and 3) paternal family history of AD (UK Biobank). Finally, a combined meta-analysis of 368,440 individuals that included these three summary statistics was used as final outcome. GSMR applied to the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project dataset revealed a significant effect of high SBP lowering the risk of AD (β = -0.19, p = .04).

Due to the clear mathematical properties, the modified Haseman-Elston regression has been found a bridge that connects and develops various parallel heritability estimation methods. With the increasing sample size, estimating heritability for biobank-scale data poses a challenge for statistical computation, in particular that the calculation of the genetic relationship matrix is a huge challenge in statistical computation. Using the Haseman-Elston framework, in this study we explicitly analyzed the mathematical structure of the key term (    ), the trace of high-order term of the genetic relationship matrix, a component involved in the estimation procedure. In this study, we proposed two estimators, which can estimate (    ) with greatly reduced sampling variance compared to the existing method under the same computational complexity.

This data set has been used in the past to verify that individuals with chronic diseases exhibit reduced activity levels compared with healthy populations. However, the data set is likely to be noisy, as the devices were allocated to participants without a set of inclusion criteria, and the traces reflect free-living conditions. This study aims to determine the extent to which accelerometer traces can be used to distinguish individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from normoglycemic controls and to quantify their limitations. Machine learning classifiers were trained using different feature sets to segregate individuals with T2D from normoglycemic individuals. Multiple criteria, based on a combination of self-assessment UK Biobank variables and primary care health records linked to UK Biobank participants, were used to identify 3103 individuals with T2D in this population. The remaining nondiabetic 19,852 participants were further scored on their physical activity impairment severity based on other conditions found in their primary care data, and those deemed likely physically impaired at the time were excluded. Physical activity features were first extracted from the raw accelerometer traces data set for each participant using an algorithm that extends the previously developed Biobank Accelerometry Analysis toolkit from Oxford University. These features were complemented by a selected collection of sociodemographic and lifestyle features available from UK Biobank. We tested 3 types of classifiers, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) close to 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) for all 3 classifiers and F1 scores in the range of 0.80-0.82 for T2D-positive individuals and 0.73-0.74 for T2D-negative controls. Results obtained using nonphysically impaired controls were compared with highly physically impaired controls to test the hypothesis that nondiabetic conditions reduce classifier performance. Models built using a training set that included highly impaired controls with other conditions had worse performance (AUC 0.75-0.77; 95% CI 0.74-0.78; F1 scores in the range of 0.76-0.77 for T2D positives and 0.63-0.65 for controls). Granular measures of free-living physical activity can be used to successfully train machine learning models that are able to discriminate between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic controls, although with limitations because of the intrinsic noise in the data sets. From a broader clinical perspective, these findings motivate further research into the use of physical activity traces as a means of screening individuals at risk of diabetes and for early detection, in conjunction with routinely used risk scores, provided that appropriate quality control is enforced on the data collection protocol.",,,accelerometry;digital biomarkers;digital phenotyping;digital technology;machine learning;mobile phone;physical activity;type 2 diabetes;

The UK Biobank recruited 502 651 individuals aged 40-69 years across the UK during 2006-10. Road traffic noise (Lden and Lnight) exposure for 2009 was estimated at baseline address using a simplified version of the Common Noise Assessment Methods model. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, area- and individual-level deprivation, season of blood draw, length of time at residence, and nitrogen dioxide (main model), in an analytical sample size of over 370 000 participants. Exposure to road-traffic Lden >65 dB[A], as compared to ≤55 dB[A], was associated with 0.77% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60%, 0.95%], 0.49% (95% CI 0.32%, 0.65%), 0.79% (95% CI 0.11%, 1.47%), and 0.12% (95% CI -0.04%, 0.28%) higher SBP, DBP, triglycerides, and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Removing BMI from the main model yielded significant positive associations with all five markers with elevated percent changes. The associations with SBP or DBP did not appear to be impacted by hypertension medication while a positive association with prevalent self-reported hypertension was seen in the non-medicated group who exposed to a Lden level of 60-65 dB[A] (odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.00, 1.15).

Diagnosis of inherited tubulopathies has improved with the advances of next generation sequencing. However, difficulties remain, such as a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation and unknown pathogenicity of newly identified variants. In addition, treatment remains mainly symptomatic. Both diagnosis and treatment can be improved by addition of  functional studies to clinical care. Urine-derived kidney organoids ( tubuloids ) are a promising platform for these studies. International collections of patient-derived tubuloids in a living biobank offer additional advantages for drug development and pathophysiological studies. In this review, we discuss how diagnosis and treatment of tubulopathies can be improved by  studies using a tubuloid biobank. We also address practical challenges in the development of such biobank.

A third of participants completed a Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ) containing the gold-standard Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) criteria for assessing mental health disorders. To investigate whether multiple observations of depression from sources other than the MHQ can enhance the validity of major depressive disorder (MDD). In participants who did not complete the MHQ, we calculated the number of other depression measures endorsed, for example from hospital episode statistics and interview data. We compared cases defined this way with CIDI-defined cases for several estimates: the variance explained by polygenic risk scores (PRS), area under the curve attributable to PRS, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-based heritability and genetic correlations with summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD genome-wide association study. The strength of the genetic contribution increased with the number of measures endorsed. For example, SNP-based heritability increased from 7% in participants who endorsed only one measure of depression, to 21% in those who endorsed four or five measures of depression. The strength of the genetic contribution to cases defined by at least two measures approximated that for CIDI-defined cases. Most genetic correlations between UK Biobank and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD study exceeded 0.7, but there was variability between pairwise comparisons. Multiple measures of depression can serve as a reliable approximation for case status where the CIDI measure is not available, indicating sample size can be optimised using the entire suite of UK Biobank data.",,,Depressive disorders;UK Biobank;classification;genetics;prospective health study;

However, the general information of biorepositories in China remained largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the size, collections, biospecimens distribution and other characteristics of Chinese biobanks in grade A tertiary hospitals. In 2018, we launched a national survey among biobank leaders to provide a comprehensive understanding of Chinese grade A tertiary hospital biobanks. A total of 70 biobank managers or directors completed an online questionnaire to collect information about the biorepositories. Nearly 20% of biobanks stored over one million specimens, while almost one-third of biobanks stored 50-200,000 specimens. In general, plasma and serum were the specimens most commonly stored. For the use of collections, biospecimens were most commonly applied by internal clinical departments. Further analyses revealed that the large-scale biobanks were characterized by earlier establishment, more types of specimens in storage and distribution compared with small-scale biobanks. Moreover, specimens in large-scale biobanks were more commonly used for basic research (62.86% vs. 34.29%,  = 0.017) and clinical research (57.14% vs. 28.57%,  = 0.016). Large-scale biobanks also had more opportunities to cooperate with domestic research institutes (34.29% vs. 5.71%,  = 0.003). Our survey revealed diversity in collections, distribution and utilization of biospecimens among Chinese grade A tertiary hospital biobanks.

The inclusion of First Nations people, in particular, is important to prevent biobanking research from exacerbating existing health inequities, and to ensure that these communities share in the benefits arising from research. To explore the perspectives of Australian Aboriginal people whose tissue - or that of their family members - has been stored in the biobank of the National Centre for Indigenous Genomics (NCIG). Semi-structured interviews with 42 Aboriginal people from the Titjikala, Galiwinku, Tiwi Islands, Yarrabah, Fitzroy Crossing, Derby, One Arm Point and Mulan communities, as well as a formal discussion with A. Hermes, an Indigenous Community Engagement Coordinator at the NCIG who had conducted the interviews. The interviews and the structured discussion were double coded using a procedure informed by Charmaz's outline of grounded theory analysis and Morse's outline of the cognitive basis of qualitative research. In this article, we report on A. Hermes' interviews with members from the above Aboriginal communities, as well as on her personal views, experiences, and interpretations of the interviews she conducted with other community members. We found that participation in the NCIG biobank raised issues around broken trust, grief and loss, but also - somewhat unexpectedly - was perceived as a source of empowerment, hope and reconnection.

However, data are scarce on the association between multiple types of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. We aimed to assess the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the subsequent risk of COVID-19 using UK Biobank. For this cohort analysis, we included participants from UK Biobank who were registered in England and excluded individuals who died before Jan 31, 2020, (the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) or had withdrawn from UK Biobank. Participants diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder before Jan 31 were included in the group of individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, whereas participants without a diagnosis before the outbreak were included in the group of individuals without pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We used the Public Health England dataset, UK Biobank hospital data, and death registers to collect data on COVID-19 cases. To examine the relationship between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and susceptibility to COVID-19, we used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs), controlling for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. Key outcomes were all COVID-19, COVID-19 specifically diagnosed in inpatient care, and COVID-19-related deaths. ORs were also estimated separately for each psychiatric disorder and on the basis of the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. As a positive disease control, we repeated analyses for hospitalisation for other infections. We included 421 014 UK Biobank participants in our study and assessed their COVID-19 status between Jan 31 and July 26, 2020. 50 809 participants were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders before the outbreak, while 370 205 participants had no psychiatric disorders. The mean age at outbreak was 67·80 years (SD 8·12). We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders compared with that of individuals without such conditions. The fully adjusted ORs were 1·44 (95% CI 1·28-1·62) for All COVID-19 cases, 1·55 (1·34-1·78) for Inpatient COVID-19 cases, and 2·03 (1·59-2·59) for COVID-19-related deaths. We observed excess risk, defined as risk that increased with the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, across all diagnostic categories of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between psychiatric disorders and elevated risk of hospitalisation due to other infections (OR 1·74, 95% CI 1·58-1·93). Our findings suggest that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for surveillance of and care for populations with pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an effort to broadly improve the quality of research studies and reduce costs and challenges associated with recruitment and sample collection, a group of diverse researchers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center led an institution-supported initiative to create a population representative pediatric  Greater Cincinnati Childhood Cohort (GCC).  Participants completed a detailed survey, underwent a brief physician-led physical exam, and provided blood, urine, and hair samples. DNA underwent high-throughput genotyping.  In total, 1,020 children ages 3-18 years living in the 7 county Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan region were recruited. Racial composition of the cohort was 84% non-Hispanic white, 15% non-Hispanic black, and 2% other race or Hispanic. Participants exhibited marked demographic and disease burden differences by race. Overall, the cohort was broadly used resulting in publications, grants and patents; yet, it did not meet the needs of all potential researchers.

To manage this tension, it is vital to identify the concerns of relevant stakeholders to ensure effective and acceptable policy and practice. This research examines the aspects of commercialisation that are of most concern to the Australian public (n = 800) and patients who had donated their tissue to two large disease specific (cancer) public biobanks (n = 564). Overall, we found a commercialisation effect (higher support for public relative to private) in relation to funding, research location and access to stored biospecimens. The effect was strongest for research locations and access compared to funding. A latent class analysis revealed the pattern of concern differed, with the majority (34.1%) opposing all aspects of commercialisation, a minority supporting all (15.7%), one quarter (26.8%) opposing some (sharing and selling tissue) but not others (research locations and funding), and a group who were unsure about most aspects but opposed selling tissue (23.5%). Patient donors were found to be more accepting of and unsure about most aspects of commercialisation. Members of the (general) public who were motivated to participate in biobanking were more likely to oppose some aspects while supporting others, while those who indicated they would not donate to a biobank were more likely to oppose all aspects of commercialisation. The results suggest that approaches to policy, engagement and awareness raising need to be tailored for different publics and patient groups to increase participation.",,,"Adult;Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Genetics, Medical;Genomics;Humans;Male;Public Opinion;Technology Transfer;Tissue and Organ Procurement"

HLA-DRB1*15:01 was associated with increased optic neuritis and cerebellar involvement and worsened visual and pyramidal functional scale (FS) scores, resulting in higher progression index values. HLA-DRB1*04:05 was associated with younger onset age, high visual FS scores, and a high tendency to develop optic neuritis. HLA-DPB1*03:01 increased brainstem and cerebellar FS scores. By contrast, HLA-DRB1*01:01 decreased spinal cord involvement and sensory FS scores, HLA-DRB1*09:01 decreased annualized relapse rate, brainstem involvement and bowel and bladder FS scores, and HLA-DRB1*13:02 decreased spinal cord and brainstem involvement.

More recently, there has also been evidence that long-term environmental exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and dementia. There are many occupations that may expose workers to airborne particles and that some exposures in the workplace are very similar to environmental particulate pollution. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank cohort to verify the association between environmental particulate air pollution (PM) exposure and T2DM and dementia, and to investigate if occupational exposure to particulates that are similar to those found in environmental air pollution could increase the odds of developing these diseases. The UK Biobank dataset comprises of over 500,000 participants from all over the UK. Environmental exposure variables were used from the UK Biobank. To estimate occupational exposure both the UK Biobank's data and information from a job exposure matrix, specifically developed for UK Biobank (Airborne Chemical Exposure-Job Exposure Matrix (ACE JEM)), were used. The outcome measures were participants with T2DM and dementia. In appropriately adjusted models, environmental exposure to PM was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.02 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.03) per unit exposure for developing T2DM, while PM was associated with an odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.16) per unit exposure for developing dementia. These environmental results align with existing findings in the published literature. Five occupational exposures (dust, fumes, diesel, mineral, and biological dust in the most recent job estimated with the ACE JEM) were investigated and the risks for most exposures for T2DM and for all the exposures for dementia were not significantly increased in the adjusted models. This was confirmed in a subgroup of participants where a full occupational history was available allowed an estimate of workplace exposures. However, when not adjusting for gender, some of the associations become significant, which suggests that there might be a bias between the occupational assessments for men and women. The results of the present study do not provide clear evidence of an association between occupational exposure to particulate matter and T2DM or dementia.",,,"Air Pollutants;Air Pollution;Biological Specimen Banks;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dementia;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Dust;Environmental Exposure;Female;Humans;Male;Minerals;Occupational Exposure;Particulate Matter;United Kingdom;ACE JEM;UK Biobank;air pollution;dementia;environmental exposure;epidemiological analysis;epidemiology;occupational exposure;particulate matter;type 2 diabetes"

We leveraged exome-sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data from 29,358 individuals in the multiethnic, randomly ascertained health system-based BioMe biobank to define effects of common and rare IBD variants on disease prediction and pathophysiology. PRS were calculated from European, African American, and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) reference case-control studies, and a meta-GWAS run using all three association datasets. PRS were then combined using regression to assess which combination of scores best predicted IBD status in European, AJ, Hispanic, and African American cohorts in BioMe. Additionally, rare variants were assessed in genes associated with very early-onset IBD (VEO-IBD), by estimating genetic penetrance in each BioMe population. Combining risk scores based on association data from distinct ancestral populations improved IBD prediction for every population in BioMe and significantly improved prediction among European ancestry UK Biobank individuals. Lower predictive power for non-Europeans was observed, reflecting in part substantially lower African IBD case-control reference sizes. We replicated associations for two VEO-IBD genes, ADAM17 and LRBA, with high dominant model penetrance in BioMe. Autosomal recessive LRBA risk alleles are associated with severe, early-onset autoimmunity; we show that heterozygous carriage of an African-predominant LRBA protein-altering allele is associated with significantly decreased LRBA and CTLA-4 expression with T-cell activation. Greater genetic diversity in African populations improves prediction across populations, and generalizes some VEO-IBD genes.

This research aimed to determine those factors important in determining the public's intention to donate a biological sample to a publicly funded biobank, and allow that sample to be linked with medical records. A national sample of 1000 Australians was surveyed via telephonic interviews. Questions included the reported likelihood that respondents would participate in biobank research, ratings of trust in biobanks, beliefs that biobank research will lead to improved health care and general ratings of comfort with blood taking and DNA analysis. The sample reported a high level of trust in university biobanks, a strong belief that biobank research will lead to improved health care and a strong willingness to participate in biobank research. Using structural equation modelling, trust in the biobank was found to be the most important determinant of intention to participate in biobank research, followed by general comfort with blood taking and DNA analysis, belief in health-care benefits and higher education. Gender, age, parental status and experience of genetic conditions were not significantly associated with intention to participate. Australians are generally willing to participate in biobank research, and this is strongly determined by trust. While benefit beliefs and comfort with research are also relevant, higher trust was associated with intention regardless of these factors, suggesting reasons other than concern for improved health care are important in determining the publics' willingness to participate in biobank research.",,,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Data Collection;Female;Forecasting;Humans;Intention;Interviews as Topic;Male;Medical Records;Middle Aged;Research;Young Adult"

By studying the examples set and lessons learned from other international biobanking studies and by devoting considerable time and resources to identifying, addressing, and continually monitoring ethical and regulatory concerns, T1DGC was able to minimize the problems reported by some earlier studies. Several important conclusions can be drawn based on the experience in this study: (1) Basic international standards for research ethics review and informed consent are broadly consistent across developed countries. (2) When consent forms are adapted locally and translated into different languages, discrepancies are inevitable and therefore require prompt central review and resolution before research is initiated. (3) Providing separate 'check-box' consent for different elements of a study creates confusion and may not be essential. (4) Creating immortalized cell lines to aid future research is broadly acceptable, both in the US and internationally.

Many biobanks have reached the stage of offering access to their collection of data and samples to the scientific community. This, however, requires that access arrangements be established to govern the relationship between biobanks and users. Access arrangements capture the convergence of all normative elements in the life cycle of a biobank: policies, laws, common practices, commitments made by the biobank to participants, the expectations of funders, and the needs of the scientific community. Furthermore, access arrangements shape new legal agreements between 'biobankers' and researchers to ensure appropriate, regulated and efficient use of biobank materials. This paper begins by examining the particularities of access arrangements, identifying the key elements of these new regulatory instruments. Second, the paper looks at various strategies used by biobanks to regulate access and surveys the underlying motivations of these strategies and the impact they can have on potential international collaboration. Third, an example of the challenges encountered in creating access policy is illustrated using the case of CARTaGENE, a biobank based in Montreal, Canada. Last, the paper presents how Public Population Project in Genomics (P(3)G) facilitates the work of biobankers and improves collaboration throughout the international human genomics research community.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;Cooperative Behavior;Genetic Research;Genomics;Humans;Informed Consent;Public Health;Public Policy;Tissue Banks;

Biobank research hopes to provide novel insights into the genetic component of disease, ultimately leading to a more personalized approach to healthcare. However, biobanks have sparked debate due to the ethical, legal, and social implications surrounding utilization of population samples and data. These controversies include issues of consent, privacy and confidentiality, return of results and data-sharing. This paper provides an overview of the different types and scope of biobanks and an examination of the most pertinent ethical, legal and social considerations surrounding such research, as well as how some of these concerns are being addressed.

Increasingly, networks have formed to help with the collection, processing, storage, advertising, and distribution of samples. However, there are also challenges to establishing and maintaining biobank networks. To classify biobanks in order to better understand the problems faced by biobank networking. Interviews were conducted with principal investigators and/or managers responsible for 33 biobanks in 9 countries. Biobanks were classified into the following categories: 'storage', 'bring-and-share', 'catalogue', 'partnership', 'contribution' and 'expertise'. It was possible to allocate all of the biobanks visited to one of the network categories although some fitted better than others. Thus, the classification may not be mutually exclusive nor encompass all types of biobanks. Many of the governance and operational problems associated with the biobanks visited were due to networking functions: either intra- or inter-biobank networks. Thus, this proposed classification system should help better understand these issues and identify solutions.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Genetic;Europe;Genetic Research;Humans;Tissue Banks"

In this essay, we consider a particular kind of collection, national biobanks. National biobanks are often presented by advocates as an economic  resource  that will be used by both basic researchers and academic biologists, as well as by pharmaceutical diagnostic and clinical genomics companies. Although national biobanks have been the subject of intense interest in recent social science literature, most prior work on this topic focuses either on bioethical issues related to biobanks, such as the question of informed consent, or on the possibilities for scientific citizenship that they make possible. We emphasize, by contrast, the economic aspect of biobanks, focusing specifically on the way in which national biobanks create biovalue. Our emphasis on the economic aspect of biobanks allows us to recognize the importance of what we call clinical labor-that is, the regularized, embodied work that members of the national population are expected to perform in their role as biobank participants-in the creation of biovalue through biobanks. Moreover, it allows us to understand how the technical way in which national biobanks link clinical labor to databases alters both medical and popular understandings of risk for common diseases and conditions.",,,

On one hand, the technical specific rules related to the activities of biobanks (on which conditions a biobank can be established, on which conditions samples can be given thereto). On the other hand, there is an application to biobanks of the big principles of  French-style  bioethics: 'non property' principle, informed consent and data confidentiality principles. We shall show that in so doing, the French legislator grasped and answered the main part of the questions raised and so paved the way for a sustained acitivity of biobanks in France. In spite of this dense legal framework, the law has not anticipated at present all the questions arising from the practice of biobanks, notably the rights of the donors such as an on-going control on the use of biological material and associated data they gave for research purposes, as well as researchers' right to access biobanks and current issues related to ownership.

One is then confronted with how to achieve public engagement that is both meaningful and effective. In particular, how can public engagement on the topic of biobanking be implemented so that (a) it is perceived broadly as legitimate and (b) the results of the engagement are relevant and useful to the institutional and regulatory context? In this paper we build on previous work that has addressed the former point and focus primarily on the latter. We argue that one way to increase the likelihood of results of public engagement being taken up in policy is through framing the issues that are deliberated by members of the public based in part on the practical policy questions for which input is sought. In this approach, we move discussion on the social and ethical implications of biobanking from abstract principles, to their consideration in the context of local biobanking practices. This is illustrated using a practical example involving a public engagement conducted to inform institutional policy for biobanking in British Columbia, Canada.",,,Bioethics;Biomedical Research;Community Participation;Female;Genomics;Global Health;Government Regulation;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Public Health;Public Opinion;Tissue Banks;

At the same time, the widely varied practices in biobanking may also pose a barrier to cross-border research and collaboration by limiting access to samples and data. Nevertheless, the extent of the actual activities and the impact of the level of networking and harmonisation have not been fully assessed. To address these issues and to obtain missing knowledge on the extent of biobanking in Europe, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, in collaboration with the European Science and Technology Observatory (ESTO), conducted a survey among European biobanks. In total, 126 biobanks from 23 countries responded to the survey. Most of them are small or medium-sized public collections set up either for population-based or disease-specific research purposes. The survey indicated a limited networking among the infrastructures. The large majority of them are stand-alone collections and only about half indicated to have a policy for cross-border sharing of samples. Yet, scientific collaborations based on the use of each biobank appear to be prominent. Significant variability was found in terms of consent requirements and related procedures as well as for privacy and data protection issues among the biobanks surveyed.

Biobanking infrastructure or comprehensive sample exchange platforms to enable networking of clinical cancer biobanks are instrumental to facilitate communication, uniform sample quality, and rules for exchange. The Organization of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) Pathobiology Working Group supports European biobanking infrastructure by maintaining the OECI-TuBaFrost exchange platform and organizing regular meetings. This platform originated from a European Commission project and is updated with knowledge from ongoing and new biobanking projects. This overview describes how European biobanking projects that have a large impact on clinical biobanking, including EuroBoNeT, SPIDIA, and BBMRI, contribute to the update of the OECI-TuBaFrost exchange platform. Combining the results of these European projects enabled the creation of an open (upon valid registration only) catalogue view of cancer biobanks and their available samples to initiate research projects. In addition, closed environments supporting active projects could be developed together with the latest views on quality, access rules, ethics, and law. With these contributions, the OECI Pathobiology Working Group contributes to and stimulates a professional attitude within biobanks at the European comprehensive cancer centers.

Blood spots are collected at the time a blood sample is donated at a health centre and before processing the blood sample at the biobank. To test the validity of our approach over time, we analyzed 26 blood spots stored at room temperature in our facilities for more than 15 years. DNA was successfully extracted from the three storage materials tested in this study and 15 STR markers plus amelogenin were subsequently analyzed. The storage of a small blood spot attached to a sample authentication form proved to be efficient for genetic profiling and, therefore, may constitute a long-lasting (at least 15 years), cost-effective and effortless approach for genetic authentication of samples in biobanks.",,,"Blood Banks;Blood Specimen Collection;DNA Fingerprinting;Genetic Markers;Humans;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Quality Control;Reagent Kits, Diagnostic;Tissue Donors"

We consider governance solutions that focus on 'bioethical-theoretical' arguments to be of only limited value in this context. By contrast, we think the key lies in developing participatory arrangements that are responsive to the views of patients and 'lay people', and also operate on a transnational level.

Motivations behind refusing to consent to DNA biobanking, with subsequent focus on participants' explanations regarding this unwillingness. Public refusal to consent to DNA biobanking, as revealed by the questionnaire, was mainly explained by a lack of personal relevance of DNA contribution and feelings of discomfort related to the DNA being used for purposes other than the respective study. Interviews of individuals representing the second motivation, revealed a significant mistrust of DNA biobank studies. The underlying beliefs and attitudes were associated with concerns about integrity, privacy, suspiciousness and insecurity. However, most interviewees were supportive of genetic research per se and interpreted their mistrust in the light of distressing environmental influences. The results suggest a need for guidelines on benefit sharing, as well as trustworthy and stable measures to maintain privacy, as a means for increasing personal relevance and trust among potential participants in genetic research.

In spite of obvious differences between biobank research and organ transplantation the cases for implementing presumption of a positive attitude appear quite analogous. It has repeatedly been shown that a majority of the general population supports these projects and selecting informed consent as the default position decreases the amount of organs and samples available and thus reduces the prospect of promoting health.

Four different countries were included in the study; namely, the UK, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. The results of the study indicate that the degree of similarity between legal systems in different countries varies according to the respective field of jurisdiction. Although personality and property rights have long been enshrined in virtually identical pieces of law, the applicable medical professional regulations were found to be somewhat heterogeneous. Furthermore, clear-cut differences were often found to be lacking between regulations that reflect either 'soft law' or the nationally binding 'hard law' that has emerged from it.

292,Donors perceptions of consent to and feedback from biobank research: time to acknowledge diversity?,"K Hoeyer",,,,,2009,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19940458/," Many studies have explored public perspectives on when and how to provide informed consent to biobank research and when to get feedback on research results. Little has been done to explore overarching trends in these studies. The article is based on a critical reading of the literature found through Medline searches and the PRIVILEGED project compilation of empirical studies. I suggest that tissue type, procurement situation including who is asked to provide consent, and the biobank's geographical, social and historical context influence how various potential donors view the issues of consent, re-consent, and feedback of research results. In light of this, universal ethical standards for informed consent to and feedback of research results from biobank research seem to run contrary to the diversity of perceptions and expectations among different donors. To respect donor interests, it is necessary to pay more attention to diversity with regard to biobank types and different contexts for donation. We should avoid assuming that words like 'biobank' and 'donor' can be used in a generic sense - always referring to the same - if we wish to respect and care for the diverse group of individuals who comprise the donating public.",,,Feedback;Humans;Tissue Banks;Tissue Donors;

This limitation is creating a growing gap between the pace of scientific advances and successful exploitation of this knowledge. Biobanks are an important conduit for transfer of biospecimens (tissues, blood, body fluids) and related health data to research. They have evolved outside of the historical source of tissue biospecimens, clinical pathology archives. Research biobanks have developed advanced standards, protocols, databases, and mechanisms to interface with researchers seeking biospecimens. However, biobanks are often limited in their capacity and ability to ensure quality in the face of increasing demand. Our strategy to enhance both capacity and quality in research biobanking is to create a new framework that repatriates the activity of biospecimen accrual for biobanks to clinical pathology. The British Columbia (BC) BioLibrary is a framework to maximize the accrual of high-quality, annotated biospecimens into biobanks. The BC BioLibrary design primarily encompasses: 1) specialized biospecimen collection units embedded within clinical pathology and linked to a biospecimen distribution system that serves biobanks; 2) a systematic process to connect potential donors with biobanks, and to connect biobanks with consented biospecimens; and 3) interdisciplinary governance and oversight informed by public opinion. The BC BioLibrary has been embraced by biobanking leaders and translational researchers throughout BC, across multiple health authorities, institutions, and disciplines. An initial pilot network of three Biospecimen Collection Units has been successfully established. In addition, two public deliberation events have been held to obtain input from the public on the BioLibrary and on issues including consent, collection of biospecimens and governance. The BC BioLibrary framework addresses common issues for clinical pathology, biobanking, and translational research across multiple institutions and clinical and research domains. We anticipate that our framework will lead to enhanced biospecimen accrual capacity and quality, reduced competition between biobanks, and a transparent process for donors that enhances public trust in biobanking.",,,Animals;Biomedical Research;British Columbia;Humans;Public Opinion;Tissue Banks;Tissue Donors;

A population survey of 2,400 randomly selected Finns aged 24-65 was conducted at the beginning of 2007. A total of 1,195 responses (50%) were received after one reminder. Of the respondents, 83% said that they had little or no knowledge of what biobanks were. Despite this, 77% regarded the setting up of a national biobank in a positive light. One third (34%) would not attach any conditions on their consent, while 42% said that it was important to regain consent when the new study contains diverging steps. One third (30%) wanted consent to be regained for every new research project, and 44% would like to decide what type of research their samples would be used for if they were included in a national biobank. One third of both men and women approved of the use of their samples in research involving private enterprises. In general, Finns were positive toward the setting up of a national biobank, as well as public-private partnerships, even though they considered their knowledge of biobanking to be limited. This, however, did not mean that they were indifferent to the use of their samples, but most wanted the ability to control how their samples are used.",,,"Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Finland;Genetic Research;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Public Opinion;Specimen Handling;Surveys and Questionnaires;Tissue Banks"

Recruitment and retention of biobank participants requires understanding the nature and magnitude of these concerns. Potential participants in a proposed biobank were asked about their willingness to participate, their privacy concerns, informed consent, and data sharing. A representative survey of 4659 U.S. adults was conducted. Ninety percent of respondents would be concerned about privacy, 56% would be concerned about researchers having their information, and 37% would worry that study data could be used against them. However, 60% would participate in the biobank if asked. Nearly half (48%) would prefer to provide consent once for all research approved by an oversight panel, whereas 42% would prefer to provide consent for each project separately. Although 92% would allow academic researchers to use study data, 80% and 75%, respectively, would grant access to government and industry researchers. Concern about privacy was related to lower willingness to participate only when respondents were told that they would receive $50 for participation and would not receive individual research results back. Among respondents who were told that they would receive $200 or individual research results, privacy concerns were not related to willingness. Survey respondents valued both privacy and participation in biomedical research. Despite pervasive privacy concerns, 60% would participate in a biobank. Assuring research participants that their privacy will be protected to the best of researchers' abilities may increase participants' acceptance of consent for broad research uses of biobank data by a wide range of researchers.",,,Adolescent;Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Privacy;Prospective Studies;Public Opinion;Young Adult;

Biobanking of human tissues has become a professionalized joint effort, including the expertise of epidemiologists, pathologists and biologists. Mostly, biobanks are used for cross-sectional studies and the obtained specimens often represent later stages of disease. Technical improvements in high-throughput genetic and proteomic screening lead to important new insights into pathophysiological processes. Atherosclerotic disease progression is a major killer in the Western society. Pathological biobanking studies revealed insights in plaque progression and destabilization. However, atherosclerotic disease is a typical example where insights into progression of the disease may be hampered by the cross-sectional design of the biobanks.

As a result of a number of tissue-related  scandals  and increasing concern about ownership and privacy, the requirements to obtain consent from tissue donors are becoming increasingly stringent. The authors' data show that members of the general public perceive academic biobank researchers and their institutions to be highly trustworthy and do not see the need for recurrent, project-specific consent. They argue, on the basis of their empirical findings, that we should question the trend, at least in some settings, toward ever more stringent consent requirements for the use of tissue in research. They argue that this approach, while perhaps counterintuitive in the current regulatory environment, can be both ethically and legally sound so long as channels of communication are maintained and third-party relationships are tightly controlled.",,,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Interviews as Topic;Male;Middle Aged;Public Opinion;Research;Trust"

In order to take advantage of these extracted gene related information extensively and precisely so as to realize the human being's biological phenomena as well as the mechanism of pathogenesis, consequentially, large scale sample collection of different geological areas and/or ethic group becomes necessary for the future population based genetic research of a country and, in turn, the construction of population-based genetic database (Biobank). In recent years, both mainland China & Taiwan have not only made great progress in information & computation technologies but have also gradually taken a close look into the quality of medicine delivery. Thus, it becomes unavoidable for both sides to create each one's population-based genetic databases (Biobank). Theoretically speaking, the Biobank development shall benefit the study on the correlation between genes and disease and, also, the solution for disease treatment. At the same time, medical diagnosis technology has also been significantly improved. It is believable that the population-based genetic database might be utilized to promote medical quality and to reduce the cost of public health delivery. Furthermore, in the near future, it might become the  raw materials  for medical research application. However, when taking the public welfare promotion as the premises for a Biobank development, severe and multi challenges occurred against traditional legal rules in terms of the privacy protection, public trust development, the compliance of informed consent principle, the implementation of a benefit-sharing doctrine and the possible discrimination concern on the population/participants selection and some other ELSI issues. In this paper, the major legal issues encountered by the Biobank development will be firstly reviewed accompanied with the background information concerning the Biobank development scenario crossing the Taiwan Strait. Also, mainly following the realm of comparative policy or legal approaches, the paper, learning from the fruits of this comparative study, tries to propose some recommendations for future legislative consideration by both mainland China & Taiwan. It's been this author's wish that, when establishing a large scale population based Biobank, the promotion of public trust shall be placed as the primary goal together with the emphasis on the supporting publicity and transparency on the administrative practices, so as to encourage the public participation in observing the principle of altruism and, in turns, benefit the future biomedicine development.",,,"Altruism;China;Databases, Genetic;Databases, Nucleic Acid;Forecasting;Genetic Privacy;Genetics, Population;Humans;Informed Consent;Public Relations;Taiwan"

Burgess conducted a public engagement, the BC Biobank Deliberation, focused on the issue of biobanks.

The public engagement was informed by political theory on deliberative democracy with the aim of informing biobanking policies, in particular in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive outline of the conclusions reached by the deliberants (both recommendations based on consensus and issues that emerged as persistent disagreements). However, the process whereby the specific conclusions to be delivered to policy makers are identified is not a self-evident process. We thus provide a critical analysis of how the results of a public engagement such as the BC Biobank Deliberation can be conceptualized given the context of a large qualitative data set and an imperative to provide useful information to policy makers, while honoring the mandate under which deliberants were recruited. In particular, we make the case for distinguishing between deliberative outputs of public engagement and analytical outputs that are the product of social scientific analyses of such engagements.",,,"Adult;Aged;British Columbia;Community Participation;Humans;Middle Aged;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Tissue Banks"

Our main preoccupation relates to the substantial provisions governing the collection, the research use and the conservation of biological samples. Our contribution starts in the second part with a brief description of the definition of  biobank  in the Spanish Act. Subsequently, in the third part, we deal extensively with the legal conditions for the collection, use and conservation of biological samples and accompanying data for biomedical research purposes. In the fourth part we examine the specific legal framework of research biobanks in Spain, with a special focus on the source's right to know or not to know, his right to privacy and his right to non-discrimination. A discussion of the main characteristics of the Act and some conclusions finalise this article. In stead of summarising these conclusions in our own words, we prefer to cite the legislator who stated in the preamble to the Act the following:  The regulation on the obtaining, conservation, use and assignment of biological samples is likewise object of a detailed regulation. As is logical, the legal framework turns once again on the consent of the source of the samples and on the previous information that must be provided to this respect. In so far as the disjunctive on the possibility to grant a completely generic or a specific consent on the use or latter uses of the sample, the Law has chosen an intermediate and flexible regulation, in that the initial consent may provide coverage, if in the information previously provided to the subject source there has been a provision about later researches related with the initial, including the researches that may be undertaken by third parties and the assignment of the data or of identified or identifiable samples to them .",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Informed Consent;Social Control, Formal;Spain"

Newer biobanks (post year 2000) deploy standard operating procedures to reduce variability around biospecimen collection. Because current translational research is based on pre-2000 and post-2000 era biospecimens, we consider whether the collection era may influence gene expression data. We compared the range of breast tumor collection times from pre-2000 and post-2000 era biobanks and compared estrogen receptor (ER) protein expression with collection time. We then collected 10 breast tumor biospecimens under a standardized protocol and examined whether the expression of c-myc and ER was influenced by storage on ice < or = 24 hours. The range of collection times achieved at a pre-2000 versus post-2000 era biobank differed. Thirty-two percent of biospecimens were cryopreserved within 30 minutes at the pre-2000 era biobank versus 76% at the post-2000 era biobank. Collection time and ER protein level was inversely correlated (r = -0.19, P = 0.025; n = 137). We observed a wide range in initial c-myc and ER mRNA levels (50- versus 130-fold). Although mRNA levels of both genes declined with increasing collection time, the rate of change differed because c-myc was significantly reduced after 24 hours (mean reduction to 79% of initial) versus ER (94% of initial). The overall shift in biobanking around the year 2000 is reflected in the ranges of collection times associated with pre-2000 and post-2000 era biobanks. Because collection time can differentially alter gene expression, the biospecimen collection era should be considered in gene expression studies.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Blotting, Northern;Breast Neoplasms;British Columbia;Carrier Proteins;Chi-Square Distribution;DNA-Binding Proteins;Gene Expression;Humans;Manitoba;RNA, Messenger;Receptors, Estrogen;Registries;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Time Factors;Transcription Factors"

Many institutions have extensive biobank holdings collected over a number of years for clinical and teaching purposes, but are uncertain as to the proper circumstances in which to permit research uses of these samples. Research Ethics Boards (REBs) in Canada and elsewhere in the world are grappling with these issues, but lack clear guidance regarding their role in the creation of and access to registries and biobanks. Chairs of 34 REBS and/or REB Administrators affiliated with Faculties of Medicine in Canadian universities were interviewed. Interviews consisted of structured questions dealing with diabetes-related scenarios, with open-ended responses and probing for rationales. The two scenarios involved the development of a diabetes registry using clinical encounter data across several physicians' practices, and the addition of biological samples to the registry to create a biobank. There was a wide range of responses given for the questions raised in the scenarios, indicating a lack of clarity about the role of REBs in registries and biobanks. With respect to the creation of a registry, a minority of sites felt that consent was not required for the information to be entered into the registry. Whether patient consent was required for information to be entered into the registry and the duration for which the consent would be operative differed across sites. With respect to the creation of a biobank linked to the registry, a majority of sites viewed biobank information as qualitatively different from other types of personal health information. All respondents agreed that patient consent was needed for blood samples to be placed in the biobank but the duration of consent again varied. Participants were more attuned to issues surrounding biobanks as compared to registries and demonstrated a higher level of concern regarding biobanks. As registries and biobanks expand, there is a need for critical analysis of suitable roles for REBs and subsequent guidance on these topics.

Human biobanks occur in research, technological development and medical activities. Population genomics is highly dependent on the availability of large biobanks. Ethical issues must be considered: protecting the rights of those people whose samples or data are in biobanks (information, autonomy, confidentiality, protection of private life), assuring the non-commercial use of human body elements and the optimal use of samples and data. They balance other issues, such as protecting the rights of researchers and companies, allowing long-term use of biobanks while detailed information on future uses is not available. At the level of populations, the traditional form of informed consent is challenged. Other dimensions relate to the rights of a group as such, in addition to individual rights. Conditions of return of results and/or benefit to a population need to be defined. With 'large-scale biobanking' a marked trend in genomics, new societal dimensions appear, regarding communication, debate, regulation, societal control and valorization of such large biobanks. Exploring how genomics can help health sector biobanks to become more rationally constituted and exploited is an interesting perspective. For example, evaluating how genomic approaches can help in optimizing haematopoietic stem cell donor registries using new markers and high-throughput techniques to increase immunogenetic variability in such registries is a challenge currently being addressed. Ethical issues in such contexts are important, as not only individual decisions or projects are concerned, but also national policies in the international arena and organization of democratic debate about science, medicine and society.",,,

Refusal to consent to biobank research in Sweden is rare, and the interests of individuals and research interests need not be at odds. The Swedish healthcare organisation is currently obliged to obtain either consent or refusal to each potential use of each sample taken, and lack of consent to research is used as the default position. A system of presumed consent with straightforward opt out would correspond with people's attitudes, as expressed in their actions, towards biobank research.",,,Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Refusal to Participate;Sweden;Tissue Banks;Tissue and Organ Procurement;

OECI TuBaFrost consists of: * A code of conduct on how to exchange human residual samples in Europe, * A central database application accessible over the Internet (www.tubafrost.org) where data can be uploaded and searched from samples that can be selected and ordered, * Access rules with incentives for collectors, * Standardization needed to enable the analysis of high quality samples derived from different centers, * Virtual Microscopy to support sample selection with difficult pathology. The entire infrastructure was, after completion, which was entirely financed by the European Commission, implemented in the OECI. But so far it has not been used to its capacity. A recent survey held amongst the OECI members shed light on the causes. The main conclusion is that all responders see OECI TuBaFrost as a good platform for exchange of samples, however, the biggest bottleneck found was that potential users are too unfamiliar with the communication between their own biobank tracking system and the TuBaFrost central database application. Therefore, new future plans are drawn. In addition, new infrastructure plans have been developed and the first preparatory steps have been set.

Many legal documents and principles within Europe, with a direct impact on biobanking, have not been developed specifically to support this activity. Moreover, while some new regulations have been set up at national level, there are many variations in the definitions, scope and purpose of these legal instruments. This has resulted in unnecessary hurdles for genome-based research, particularly if samples are shared across national borders. The question is also raised on whether new, specific legislative and governance frameworks designed for biobanking are needed, or whether it is sufficient to modify current general law and to develop specific guidelines, or to accommodate issues raised by biobanking in the current regulation. A workshop with experts from academia and industry, lawyers, national data protection authorities, representatives from the European Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor was held to review the existing legal bottlenecks and future needs of biobanking, with special regard to the collection, exchange and linkage of samples and data. This report presents highlights of the presentations and discussions from the workshop held in Sevilla, Spain, in March 2007 and the conclusions that followed.

It involves the collection of blood and urine from 500 000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years. How the samples are collected, processed and stored will have a major impact on the future scientific usefulness of the UK Biobank resource. A series of validation studies was recommended to test the robustness of the draft sample handling and storage protocol. Samples of blood and urine were collected from 40 healthy volunteers and either processed immediately according to the protocol or maintained at specified temperatures (4 degrees C for all tubes with the exception of vacutainers containing acid citrate dextrose that were maintained at 18 degrees C) for 12, 24 or 36 h prior to processing. A further sample was maintained for 24 h at 4 degrees C, processed and the aliquots frozen at -80 degrees C for 20 days and then thawed under controlled conditions. The stability of the samples was compared for the different times in a wide variety of assays. The samples maintained at 4 degrees C were stable for at least 24 h after collection for a wide range of assays. Small but significant changes were observed in metabonomic studies in samples maintained at 4 degrees C for 36 h. There was no degradation of the samples for a range of biochemical assays after short-term freezing and thawing under controlled conditions. Whole blood maintained at 18 degrees C for 24 h in vacutainers containing acid citrate dextrose is suitable for viral immortalization techniques.

DNA biobanks may assist in the research and identification of genetic factors influencing disease and drug interactions, but may raise ethical issues. How healthcare providers perceive DNA biobanks is unknown. To determine how useful healthcare professionals believe DNA biobanks will be and whether these attitudes differ between private and socialized healthcare systems. The authors surveyed 200 healthcare professionals, including research and non-research focused doctors, nurses and other staff from medical centers and independent practice in both the United States and Scotland. The survey included fifteen items evaluated for general receptiveness toward biobanks, presumed usefulness of biobanks and perceived attitudes in recruiting patients for a biobank. A total of 81 (45%) of 179 eligible participants responded: 41 from the U.S. and 40 from Scotland. Of these respondents, most (70%) were from academic centers. Results indicate that there is a broadly favorable attitude in both locations toward the creation of a DNA biobank (83%) and its perceived benefit (75%). This enthusiasm is tempered in Scotland when respondents evaluated their comfort in consenting patients for entry into a biobank; 16 of 40 respondents (40%) were uncomfortable doing so, representing a significant difference from those in the U.S. (p=0.001). Despite systematic differences in healthcare practice between the U.S. and Scotland, health care professionals in both nations believe DNA biobanks will be useful in curing disease.

Biobank governance is always a response to sociocultural challenges and requires the building of trust, acceptance, and careful political negotiation. Biobanks are regulated in networks of governance in which the state is one actor next to others, and the ordering and structuring of the interaction between biobanks, society, and politics operates through a variety of actors, on different levels and along particular rationalities. Such networks of governance reflect, to some extent, a postregulatory state in which governance has become a complicated architecture and field of action involving a multitude of forces and rationalities.

Scientists want efficient access to and use of human biological samples. Patients and other donors of blood or tissue materials want protection of their integrity. This dichotomy is reflected in the Swedish law on biobanks, which came into effect 1 January 2003. In this article I argue that if the basic interest of scientists using human biological samples is in increasing knowledge and developing better treatments, and if the concept 'integrity' is properly understood, then sample donors should also be interested in promotion of efficiency as well as in the protection of their integrity. The basic premise of this argument is that donors of samples have interests related to the donation and use of samples as well as to the use of the results of the research, that is, new medical products and treatments. They have a role both as donors or participants in research and as end users of the research. I conclude that if (i) access to information acquired through biobank research is strictly limited to researchers, (ii) the information is protected by secrecy safeguards through coding and (iii) the procedures governing the research are open to public and democratic control, then most research using human biobanks may be carried out on the basis of making general information available when collecting biological samples, without further contact with participants.",,,"Access to Information;Biological Specimen Banks;Blood Banks;Blood Donors;Confidentiality;Ethics, Research;Humans;Research Subjects;Sweden;Tissue Donors"

339,A biobank management model applicable to biomedical research.,"Christiane Auray-Blais,Johane Patenaude",,,,,2006,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16600040/," The work of Research Ethics Boards (REBs), especially when involving genetics research and biobanks, has become more challenging with the growth of biotechnology and biomedical research. Some REBs have even rejected research projects where the use of a biobank with coded samples was an integral part of the study, the greatest fear being the lack of participant protection and uncontrolled use of biological samples or related genetic data. The risks of discrimination and stigmatization are a recurrent issue. In light of the increasing interest in biomedical research and the resulting benefits to the health of participants, it is imperative that practical solutions be found to the problems associated with the management of biobanks: namely, protecting the integrity of the research participants, as well as guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of the participant's information. We aimed to devise a practical and efficient model for the management of biobanks in biomedical research where a medical archivist plays the pivotal role as a data-protection officer. The model had to reduce the burden placed on REBs responsible for the evaluation of genetics projects and, at the same time, maximize the protection of research participants. The proposed model includes the following: 1) a means of protecting the information in biobanks, 2) offers ways to provide follow-up information requested about the participants, 3) protects the participant's confidentiality and 4) adequately deals with the ethical issues at stake in biobanking. Until a governmental governance body is established in Quebec to guarantee the protection of research participants and establish harmonized guidelines for the management of biobanks in medical research, it is definitely up to REBs to find solutions that the present lack of guidelines poses. The model presented in this article offers a practical solution on a day-to-day basis for REBs, as well as researchers by promoting an archivist to a pivotal role in the process. It assures protection of all participants who altruistically donate their samples to generate and improve knowledge for better diagnosis and medical treatment.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Genetic;Drug Industry;Ethics Committees, Research;Genetic Privacy;Genetic Research;Guidelines as Topic;Humans;Informed Consent;Models, Organizational;Quebec;Research Subjects;Tissue Donors;Biomedical and Behavioral Research;Genetics and Reproduction"

We sent a questionnaire to all RECs in France to survey their concerns and the ethical criteria used when evaluating research involving the storage of biological samples. Most of the RECs think that they should be consulted to evaluate the constitution of biobanks. The proportion of RECs of this opinion depended on whether the biobank is being constituted in the absence of an associated research project (initially created for clinical purposes or for undefined research) (14/28), whether the biobank is being constituted for research use (21/28) or whether an existing research biobank is being re-used (19/28). Views diverged concerning the way ethics principles are applied, showing that REC evaluations of biobanks might be formalised at each of the following steps: constitution, use and re-use.

However, regulations for patient consent that are too strict and discrepancies in national policies on informed consent might hinder progress. Therefore, establishment of common ground for ethical review of biobank research is essential. In this essay, broad consent is defined on a scale between strictly specified (eg, for a specific study) and blanket consent (ie, with no restrictions regarding the purpose of the research). Future research includes that which might not be planned or even conceptualised when consent is obtained. In conclusion, broad consent and consent for future research are valid ethically and should be recommended for biobank research provided that: personal information related to research is handled safely; donors of biological samples are granted the right to withdraw consent; and new research studies or changes to the legal or ethical authority of a biobank are approved by an ethics-review board.",,,"Confidentiality;Ethics, Medical;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Informed Consent;Research;Tissue Banks;Tissue Donors"

According to the guidelines we have studied, this right applies also to research on biological samples. However, research conducted on human subjects themselves differs in important respects from research on biological samples. It is therefore not obvious that the same rights should be granted research participants in the two cases. This paper investigates arguments for and against granting a right to withdraw consent to research on biobank samples. We conclude that (1) there are no explicit arguments for such a right in the guidelines we have studied, (2) the arguments against such a right are inconclusive, (3) considerations of autonomy, privacy, personal integrity, and trust in medical research provide sufficient reasons for granting a right to withdraw consent to research on biobank samples, (4) in certain cases, research participants should be allowed to waive this right.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Ethics, Research;Genetic Research;Human Rights;Humans;Informed Consent;Personal Autonomy;Privacy;Refusal to Participate;Research Subjects;Researcher-Subject Relations;Analytical Approach;Biomedical and Behavioral Research;Genetics and Reproduction"

There is less risk involved in biobank research than in human subject research; it should therefore be treated differently. In our view, anonymization should not be an automatically permissible response to requests for withdrawal. Nor should a request for withdrawal necessarily stop research on identifiable samples. Apart from not being particularly appropriate for protecting the interests of individuals, anonymization of samples has a negative impact on research. We suggest that the current view on withdrawal from research, supported by the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent ethical guidelines, be abandoned in the context of biobank research and be replaced by an approach inspired by the Nuremberg Code. This approach requires those wishing to withdraw their samples from research to present sufficient reason for doing so. Our interpretation of 'sufficient reason' includes all those involving genuine, deeply felt concerns that are not based on misconceptions. Still, this underlines the fact that we all share a responsibility for health research and that no one should take withdrawal from biobank research lightly.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Codes of Ethics;Confidentiality;Ethical Review;Ethics, Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Personal Autonomy;Refusal to Participate;Research Subjects"

In Britain, however, a proposal for a genetic database, UK Biobank, has been the focus of a number of concerns. Establishing consent and legitimacy for any controversial biomedical research involving the participation of human subjects is difficult; it is however, acute for UK Biobank given the scale of the project and the criticisms levelled at it. Analysing recently published documents pertaining to UK Biobank, this article examines how consent for the project has been discursively framed and how this is reflected in its governance. It is argued that the problem of organising consent has been framed narrowly in terms of adherence to a well-established repertoire of institutional mechanisms which serves to limit debate on the substantive issues at stake. There is little evidence of reflection on the adequacy of such mechanisms for dealing with the unique challenges posed by UK Biobank, including achieving the confidence and participation of a population with diverse perspectives on genetic research. It is concluded that a restricted public discourse about UK Biobank may contribute to a decline in confidence in regulatory systems governing biotechnology and science more generally.",,,"Aged;Confidentiality;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Middle Aged;United Kingdom"

Most RECs felt they should evaluate the constitution of biobanks in protocols, but not all did so in practice. Harmonization of the competence of RECs for evaluating biobanks is required, particularly concerning information, consent, the duration of sample conservation and the communication of research results.

For-profit companies have assumed a leading role in assembling and managing these collections. The emergence of commercial biobanks has raised significant ethical and legal issues. The growing awareness of the importance of human biological material in research has been accompanied by a growing awareness of the deficiencies of existing archives of tissue. Commercial biobanks are attempting to position themselves as a, if not the, solution to problems that include a lack of public trust in researchers and lack of financial resources to support the prospective creation of collections that meet the highest scientific and ethical standards in the non-profit sector. Broad social and policy questions surrounding the operation of commercial biobanks have been raised however. International documents, in particular, suggest discomfort with the idea of gain from the mere transfer or exchange of human genetic material and information. Commercial involvement in the development of useful products from tissue is generally not condemned, so long as there is attention to scientific and social norms. Views on the acceptability of commercial biobanks vary. Specific issues that arise when commercial biobanks are permitted--in the areas of consent, recruitment, confidentiality, and accountability--are also relevant to the operation of public and private, non-profit biobanks. Although many uncertainties remain, consensus seems to be forming on a number of issues. For example, there appears to be agreement that blanket consent to future unspecified research uses, with no conditions, is unacceptable. Indeed, many of the leading commercial biobanks have been attentive to concerns about consent, recruitment, and confidentiality. Unfortunately, the binding nature of assurances in these areas is unclear, especially given the risk of insolvency. Hence, accountability may be the most important area of concern in relation to commercial biobanks. A few countries have enacted general legislation providing for comprehensive regulation of biobanks, for example, through licensure. Efforts to achieve harmonization of standards at the international level, and cautions against an approach that focuses on biobanking for genetic research alone, are to be applauded.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Commerce;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Research;Humans;Biomedical and Behavioral Research;Genetics and Reproduction;Legal Approach"

Their status is not clearly defined. We aimed to investigate human biobanking in Europe, particularly in relation to organisational, economic and ethical issues in various national contexts. Data from a survey in six EU countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK) were collected as part of a European Research Project examining human and non-human biobanking (EUROGENBANK, coordinated by Professor JC Galloux). A total of 147 institutions concerned with biobanking of human samples and data were investigated by questionnaires and interviews. Most institutions surveyed belong to the public or private non-profit-making sectors, which have a key role in biobanking. This activity is increasing in all countries because few samples are discarded and genetic research is proliferating. Collections vary in size, many being small and only a few very large. Their purpose is often research, or research and healthcare, mostly in the context of disease studies. A specific budget is very rarely allocated to biobanking and costs are not often evaluated. Samples are usually provided free of charge and gifts and exchanges are the common rule. Good practice guidelines are generally followed and quality controls are performed but quality procedures are not always clearly explained. Associated data are usually computerised (identified or identifiable samples). Biobankers generally favour centralisation of data rather than of samples. Legal and ethical harmonisation within Europe is considered likely to facilitate international collaboration.

The paper analyses the types of obligations that members of the public may wish to see incorporated in biobank benefit sharing arrangements and the extent to which their views might be influenced by underlying norms of sharing behaviour. Latent class analysis of the dataset reveals three distinct classes of respondents. We link one of these with the norm of reciprocity, one with the norm of social responsibility.

Our objective was to explore how parents would respond to the inclusion of children in an opt-out model biobank. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with parents in hospital-based pediatric clinics. Participants responded to a description of a biorepository already collecting samples from adults. Two coders independently analyzed and coded interviews using framework analysis. Opt-out forms were later piloted in a clinic area. Parental opt-out choices were recorded electronically, with opt-out rates reported here. RESULTS: Parents strongly supported medical research in general and expressed a high level of trust that Vanderbilt University would keep their child's medical information private. Parents were more likely to allow their child's sample to be included in the biorepository than to allow their child to participate in a hypothetical study that would not help or harm their child, but might help other children. Only a minority were able to volunteer a concern raised by the description of the biobank. The opt-out rate was initially high compared with the opt-out rate in the adult biorepository, but after the first week decreased to near the baseline in adult clinics. CONCLUSION: Parents in our study generally support an opt-out model biobank in children. Most would allow their own child's sample to be included. Institutions seeking to build pediatric biobanks may consider the human non-subjects model as a viable alternative to traditional human-subjects biobanks.",,,

Many critics have questioned whether the current system of informed consent can be meaningfully applied to genomic biobanking. Proposals for reform have come from many directions, but have tended to involve incremental change in current informed consent practice. This paper reports on our efforts to seek new ideas and approaches from those whom informed consent is designed to protect: research subjects. Our model emerged from semi-structured interviews with healthy volunteers who had been recruited to join either of two biobanks (some joined, some did not), and whom we encouraged to explain their concerns and how they understood the relationship between specimen contributors and biobanks. These subjects spoke about their DNA and the information it contains in ways that were strikingly evocative of the legal concept of the trade secret. They then described the terms and conditions under which they might let others study their DNA, and there was a compelling analogy to the commonplace practice of trade secret licensing. We propose a novel biobanking model based on this trade secret concept, and argue that it would be a practical, legal, and ethical improvement on the status quo.",,,"Attitude to Health;Biological Specimen Banks;Confidentiality;Genome, Human;Gift Giving;Government Regulation;Humans;Informed Consent;Licensure;Models, Theoretical;Ownership;Tissue Donors;United States"

Meeting the demands of both sample quality and governance can be challenging, especially in a resource limited environment. Frequently, differences between biobank processes reduce the ability for cooperative action and specimen sharing with researchers. In the Canadian context, we have made an attempt to identify these gaps and have provided a framework to support excellence, initially for tumor biobanks. The Canadian Tumour Repository Network (CTRNet) was established with funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Sciences (CIHR) Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) to foster translational research through improved access to high quality tumour biospecimens. Consistent with this mandate, CTRNet has focused on the establishment and deployment of common standards to harmonize biospecimen quality and approaches to governance. More recently, CTRNet has implemented a certification program to communicate these standards in conjunction with simultaneous exposure to education focusing on the rationale and foundations underlying these standards. The CTRNet certification program comprises registration and certification steps as two linked phases. In the registration phase, launched in November 2011, biobanks are registered into the system and individuals complete an introductory educational module. In the subsequent certification phase, the type of biobank is classified and assigned relevant educational modules and adoption of relevant standards of practice is confirmed through review of documentation including policies and protocols that address the CTRNet Required Operational Practices (ROPs). An important feature of the program is that it is intended for all types of tumor biobanks, so the scope and extent of assessment is scaled to the type of biobank.

Here, we tested the suitability of WGA and WTA for tumor tissue biobanking. DNA and RNA from 13 standardized and seven non-standardized frozen and 12 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clear cell renal cell carcinoma specimens (>9 years old) served to test the robustness of the WGA and WTA products by reidentifying von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations known to exist in these samples. The enrichment of DNA and RNA from frozen tissue was up to 1,291-fold and 423-fold, respectively. The sizes and yields (10- to 73-fold) of the amplified DNA obtained from the 12 FFPE samples were generally lower. The quality of the RNA from the FFPE samples was too low to reliably perform WTA. Our results demonstrate that frozen tumor tissue is very suitable for WGA and WTA. All 20 VHL mutations were verified with WGA. Notably, we were able to show that 18 of the 20 (90 %) VHL mutations are also transcribed. In FFPE tumor tissue, 8 of 12 cases (67 %) showed the expected mutations after the first WGA. Accurate WTA with FFPE material is sophisticated and strongly depends on the modification and degradation status of the fixed tissue. We conclude that for sustainable tissue biobanking, the use of WGA and WTA is a unique opportunity to provide researchers with sufficient amounts of nucleic acids, preferably from limited frozen tissue material.",,,"Carcinoma, Renal Cell;DNA, Neoplasm;Gene Expression Profiling;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Kidney Neoplasms;Mutation;Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques;RNA, Neoplasm;Specimen Handling;Tissue Banks;Transcriptome;Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein"

In order to take advantage of this extracted gene related information extensively and precisely so as to realize man's biological phenomena as well as the mechanism of pathogenesis, consequentially, a large scale sample collection of different geological areas and/or ethnic groups becomes necessary for the future population based genetic research of a country and, in turn, the construction of population-based genetic database (Biobank). In recent years, both mainland China and Taiwan have not only made great progress in information and computation technologies, but have also gradually taken a close look into the quality of medicine delivery. Thus, it becomes unavoidable for both sides to create each one's population-based genetic databases (Biobank). Theoretically speaking, the Biobank development shall benefit the study on the correlation between genes and disease and also the solution for disease treatment as well. At the same time, medical diagnostic technology has also been significantly improved. It is believable that the population-based genetic database might be utilized to promote medical quality and to reduce the cost of public health delivery. Further; in the near future, it might become the  raw materials  for medical research application. However when taking promotion of public welfare as the premises for a Biobank development, the severe and multi challenge occurred against the traditional legal rules in terms of the privacy protection, public trust development, the compliance of informed consent principle, the implementation of benefit-sharing doctrine and the possible discrimination concern about the population/participants selection and some other ELSI issues. In this paper, the major legal issues encountered by the Biobank development will first be reviewed accompanied by the background information concerning the Biobank development scenario crossing the Taiwan Strait. Also, mainly following the realm of comparative policy or legal approaches, the paper learning from the fruits of this comparative study, tries to propose some recommendations for future legislative consideration by both mainland China and Taiwan. It's been this author's wish that, when establishing a large scale population based Biobank, the promotion of public trust shall be placed as the primary goal together with the emphasis on supporting publicity and transparency on the administrative practices, so as to encourage the public participation in observing the principle of altruism and, in turn, benefit the future biomedicine development.",,,"China;Confidentiality;Databases, Genetic;Humans;Information Dissemination;Informed Consent;Ownership;Public Opinion;Public Policy;Taiwan;Trust"

Due to lack of data related to public knowledge and attitude towards biospecimen-based research and their willingness to participate in biobanking, a structured questionnaire was conducted at the national level. Data were collected from 3196 individuals aged 18 and above, constituting a representative sample of the Jordanian population. Demographic data included age, gender, and education level. Although there was lack of knowledge of the term  biological samples,  80% of respondents approved the use of biospecimens in research. In addition, almost two-thirds of respondents agreed to donate both biospecimens and relevant information for biobanking. Approval of biospecimen-based research and willingness to participate in biobanking significantly correlated with younger age and increasing education, but not gender. Our results provide an insight into the perception of biobanking among the Jordanian population and strengthen the importance of educating the public about research and the value of biobanking. The data should enable researchers in Jordan and surrounding countries of similar culture to lay the foundation for a successful biobank and research program.",,,Adolescent;Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Community Participation;Female;Humans;Jordan;Male;Middle Aged;Perception;Public Opinion;Young Adult;

In order to facilitate the discovery of underutilized biobank samples, it would be helpful if a global biobank register containing descriptive information about the samples existed. But first, for shared data to be comparable, it needs to be harmonized. In compliance with the aim of BBMRI (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure), to harmonize biobanking across Europe, and the conclusion that the move towards a universal information infrastructure for biobanking is directly connected to the issues of semantic interoperability through standardized message formats and controlled terminologies, we have developed an updated version of the minimum data set for biobanks and studies using human biospecimens. The data set called MIABIS (Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing) consists of 52 attributes describing a biobank's content. The aim is to facilitate data discovery through harmonization of data elements describing a biobank at the aggregate level. As many biobanks across Europe possess a tremendous amount of samples that are underutilized, this would help pave the way for biobank networking on a national and international level, resulting in time and cost savings and faster emergence of new scientific results.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Factual;Europe;Humans"

However, ethical and cultural considerations about use of these samples for research warrant attention. Literature about how Alaska Native people (ANs) view biobanking research consists largely of theoretical papers and position statements with limited systematic information gathered from a broad range of ANs. To explore the views of biobanking research among AN community members and leaders across Alaska using a community-based participatory research approach with tribal and federal partners. We approached tribal health organizations (THOs) to partner and guide the study in their regions. Community liaisons were hired to lead study recruitment. Twenty-nine focus groups were conducted in 14 locations with participation from 82 community members and 81 tribal leaders. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. We identified five themes that contributed to participants' views on biobanking: (1) Prior experiences with research and medical care, (2) stigmatizations, relevance, and applicability, (3) effects of governmental and cultural change, (4) concerns about unknown capability of future technologies, and (5) benefit for future generations. Respondents raised AN-specific cultural concerns along with global ethical concerns alongside the potential promise of research in improving AN health. This study offers considerations for researchers partnering with AN communities when planning research and public health surveillance projects.

They have become increasingly common as a means to determine the relationship between lifestyle, environmental exposures and predisposition to genetic disease. More and more countries are developing massive national scale biobanks, including Iceland, the UK and Estonia. Now several large-scale regional and national biobanks are planned in China, such as Shanghai Biobank, which is defined as a key-element in Shanghai's twelfth five-year Development Plan of Science and Technology. It is imperative that the authors who are in charge of the ethical aspect of Shanghai Biobank discuss the ethical aspects of these biobanks up front. Currently there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the approaches to informed consent taken by different countries.

In this study, public perceptions of biobanks and collection of genetic and health data were analyzed in relation to other technologies and digital networks where personal information is compiled and distributed. In this setting, people contextualized biobanks in line with their daily experiences with other technologies and data streams. The analysis was based on 18 focus group discussions conducted in Austria, Finland and Germany. We examined the ways in which people frame and talk about problems and benefits of information distribution in digital networks and biobanks. People identify many challenges associated with collection of personal data in the information society. The study showed that instead of privacy - which has been the key term of bioethical debates on biobanks - the notions of control and controllability are most essential for people. From the viewpoint of biobanks, issues of controllability pose challenges. In the information society, people have become accustomed to controlling personal data, which is particularly difficult in relation to biobanks.

This study used focus groups to explore how potential and actual participants of biobanks in the UK and Germany negotiate the relationship between concerns over privacy protection, reciprocity and benefit sharing. In Germany, 15 focus groups (n = 151) were conducted: 11 general public groups (n = 116) and 4 with former cohort study participants including the KORA and the Popgen cohort study (n = 35). In the UK, 9 focus groups (n = 61) were conducted: 4 general public groups (n = 33) and 5 with UK Biobank and European Huntington's Disease (Euro-HD) Registry biorepository participants (n = 28). Forms of reciprocity were found to partially mitigate potential and actual biobank participants' concerns over personal privacy risks and future unintended consequences of biobank in both Germany and the UK. Specifically, notions of individual reciprocity were at the forefront in the context of personal disadvantages to participation, while communal reciprocity was prominent when potential and actual participants were discussing the uncertainty of the long-term nature of biobanking. The research indicates that reciprocity can be viewed as a mode to deal with individuals' concerns about participating in a biobank, both by acting as a return 'favor' or 'gift,' and through establishing an ongoing relationship between participants, researchers and society. It is suggested that future biobanking projects will need to flexibly combine individual and communal forms of reciprocity if they are to recruit and maintain sufficient numbers of participants.",,,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cohort Studies;Communication;Female;Focus Groups;Germany;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Privacy;Public Opinion;Social Behavior;United Kingdom;Young Adult"

However, little is known about the attitudes of medical researchers who use biobanks for research to these issues. Four focus groups with medical researchers in the UK were conducted in 2010-2011. The study highlights a range of issues associated with the research oversight and consent process (including obtaining ethical approval to use biobank samples and particular concerns for international studies), the benefits and limitations of broad consent and the possibilities of revoking consent. Many of these issues originate in the relatively static consent processes that currently govern the biobanking process. However, it is now possible to develop reliable, dynamic processes using information technology that can resolve many of these ethical and legal concerns.

For example, small children have only limited capacity, if any, to understand the meaning and implications of the research and to give a documented agreement to it. Older minors are gradually acquiring this capacity. We describe principles for good practice related to the inclusion of minors in biobank research, focusing on issues related to benefits and subsidiarity, consent, proportionality and return of results.

There is growing recognition that a common strategy is imperative to develop biobanking globally and effectively. To help guide this strategy, we articulate key principles, goals, and priorities underpinning a roadmap for global biobanking to accelerate health science, patient care, and public health. The need to manage and share very large amounts of data has driven innovations on many fronts. Although technological solutions are allowing biobanks to reach new levels of integration, increasingly powerful data-collection tools, analytical techniques, and the results they generate raise new ethical and legal issues and challenges, necessitating a reconsideration of previous policies, practices, and ethical norms. These manifold advances and the investments that support them are also fueling opportunities for biobanks to ultimately become integral parts of health-care systems in many countries. International harmonization to increase interoperability and sustainability are two strategic priorities for biobanking. Tackling these issues requires an environment favorably inclined toward scientific funding and equipped to address socio-ethical challenges. Cooperation and collaboration must extend beyond systems to enable the exchange of data and samples to strategic alliances between many organizations, including governmental bodies, funding agencies, public and private science enterprises, and other stakeholders, including patients.

Patients' trust in doctors may therefore be important to their willingness to participate. We suggest a model of trust that makes sense of such transitions of trust between domains and distinguishes adequate trust from mistaken trust. The unique position of doctors implies, we argue, a Kantian imperfect duty to compensate for patients' mistaken trust. There are at least three kinds of mistaken trust, each of which requires a different set of countermeasures. First, trust is mistaken when necessary competence is lacking; the competence must be developed or the illusion dispelled. Second, trust is irrational whenever the patient is mistaken about his actual reasons for trusting. Care must therefore be taken to support the patient's reasoning and moral agency. Third, some patients inappropriately trust doctors to recommend only research that will benefit them directly.

An important precondition for this type of research is the establishment of biobanks. In this paper, we argue that, for the storage of samples in psychiatric biobanks, waiving of consent is not ethically justifiable since the risks cannot be considered minimal and the argument of impracticability does not apply. An opt-out consent procedure is also not justifiable, since it presumes competence while the decisional competence of psychiatric patients needs to be carefully evaluated. We state that an enhanced opt-in consent procedure is ethically necessary, i.e. a procedure that supports the patients' decision-making at the time when the patient is most competent.

Undoubtedly, the recognition of a research biobank depends on the impact of the research projects conducted with samples obtained from tumour bank(s), but also on many other criteria. It thus seems important to determine a number of indicators within a biobank to estimate objective criteria for the performance of these structures. These indicators can allow to make some strategic decisions knowing that biobanks are expensive structures to maintain in the present hospital context. The use of these indicators could also contribute to the elaboration of an  biobank impact factor of  or so called  bioresource research impact factor  (BRIF).

A task assigned to it is the addition of scientific value to the resources under its management. This task is implemented by enabling appropriate access to the resources. We reasoned that access requires not only a fair access policy but also a quality policy implemented via a Quality Management System (QMS). UDBN decided to achieve consistency in sample management by identifying and implementing a suitable QMS with external certification. UDBN selected ISO9001 as a QMS. It was soon recognized that the QMS needed to encompass not only UDBN but also the academic department in which UDBN sits. An external certification body was selected and a post was dedicated to the role of QMS-Management Representative. Specialized software was acquired. A Quality Manual, individual training files and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared. QMS training was provided. These actions led to the approval of the ISO9001:2000 standard. This is the first report of an academic genetic epidemiology research laboratory receiving approval of the ISO9001 standard to validate the consistency of its operations. ISO9001 was selected because of its greater breadth of scope compared with other QMSs. We found that while laboratory protocols are transferable between labs, QMS SOPs are not transferable. This has consequences for efforts to ensure consistency across a biobank network: joint adoption of one multiparty QMS is probably required. We found that it was not possible to implement a QMS for biobanking in isolation: its host university department needed to be included. We have found that ISO9001 helps enable longitudinal accrual of data on the use of biobanking methods. Thus ISO9001 is not only a management tool to improve access to a biobanking research infrastructure but also a research tool for research infrastructure development.",,,

For any individual biobank research system, this sequence of four maps can be created to anticipate the sources and types of IFs and IRRs to be generated, to plan how to handle them, and then to manage them responsibly over time. We discuss how this four-map tool was created and describe its application to four national biobank systems, thereby demonstrating that this tool can provide a common platform to visualize biobank content, anticipate how IFs and IRRs will arise in a biobank research context, and inform policy development.",,,"Biomedical Research;Genetics, Medical;Genomics;Humans;Incidental Findings;Medical Informatics;Research Subjects;Researcher-Subject Relations;Tissue Banks;Truth Disclosure"

Our research attempted to analyze such issues in a comprehensive manner by exploring practices, rules, and researcher opinions regarding proxy consent, minor assent, specimens and data handling, and return of results as faced in 10 European countries. Because of the lack of comparative analyses of these topics, a pilot study was designed. Following a qualitative methodology, a questionnaire draft mostly including open-ended queries was developed, tested, and sent by e-mail to a selected group of researchers dealing with pediatric biobanking (n=57). Returned questionnaires (n=31) highlighted that the collection, storage, distribution, and use of biospecimens and data from children were widely practiced in the contacted laboratories. In most cases, pediatric biobanking was subjected to national or local regulations covering adult biobanks (n=26). Informed consent was generally given by parents or legal representatives (n=17). Children's opinions were frequently sought and taken into account (n=16). However, minors were usually not recontacted at the age of maturity to express their own choices (n=26).

However, the issue is well recognized and covered in the academic literature. A related and arguably equally important issue that to date has not received much attention is how best to manage the process of identifying and initially contacting individuals for their participation in a biobank. While many population-based biobanks strive for random sampling of healthy participants from the general population, disease-based biobanks usually need to rely on some sort of referral process to achieve specificity for type and subcategories of disease. There are thus numerous ethical implications regarding the way in which this referral process is managed. In this article we begin by providing a brief outline of the nature of the problems associated with the initial introduction between a biobank and potential research participants. We then consider data from a recent public deliberation on the topic of human tissue biobanking. In these discussions, participants were posed questions regarding their views pertaining to the introduction of potential donors to biobanks, and asked to make recommendations to be considered by policy makers in British Columbia, Canada. Based on these data we conclude that there is general agreement that introduction of research biobanks to potential donors should be conducted face to face, and by a medical professional known to the donor, and depending on donor circumstances, is acceptable during either pre- or postoperative periods. The strong preference for the introduction to involve a family physician should be considered in the future design of biobank contact and consent processes.",,,

In particular, the paper focuses on the legal concept of consent and the tensions on the traditional understanding of consent that large-scale, long-term population biobanks exert. The aim of the paper is to review the operation of consent principles as they apply to population biobanks and to propose a way forward for how the consent concept can be reconceptualised to meet their demands. In particular, the paper argues for a more liberal approach which allows for 'broad' (or 'enlarged' or 'open') consent in circumstances where permission is sought for future use of samples in, as yet unspecified, genetic research. In pursuing this aim, the objectives underlying this paper are to ensure that unnecessary impediments to research are removed and, at the same time, to facilitate research participation and respect for autonomous choices by research subjects.",,,Australia;Genetic Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Tissue Banks;Trust;

Scholars provide little guidance on how deliberative outputs can be translated to policy. This paper describes the processes we undertook to design a deliberative public forum for citizens to develop recommendations on biobanking that were adopted as health policy. The 4-day forum, held in 2008 in Perth, Western Australia, was designed in collaboration with academic experts. Deliberant recommendations were recorded in a formal report presented to policy-makers. Deliberations were audio-taped and transcribed. Translation involved transcript analyses, comparison of recommendations to other stakeholder views and post-forum consultations. Sixteen citizens made recommendations on ethical, legal and social issues related to biobanking. Most recommendations were translated into biobanking guidelines, with which Western Australia government health agencies must comply. The value of deliberative public participation in policy-making was most evident when trade-offs in competing interests, hopes and concerns were required. Translation issues included the impact of a small number of participants with limited socio-demographic diversity on procedural and policy legitimacy. Assessing the sufficiency of diversity in citizen representation was central to the deliberation-to-translation process. Institutional context facilitated the uptake of deliberation and translation processes. The use of these processes influenced policy substance and credibility among stakeholders and contributed to the state government directive that policy compliance be mandatory.

Our aim is to present and utilize an analytical model for comparing structures of biobank governance. The governance model we deduce from empirical case studies is not a well-ordered, almost bureaucratic type of government. The patchwork character and the interrelatedness of heterogeneous activities that constitute biobank governance in its multiple dimensions will be highlighted. Biobank governance should therefore be understood as strategy for patterning a network of interaction that unfolds within and across a number of different fields including a variety of activities that go beyond regulatory activities: the scientific/technological field, the medical/health field, the industrial-economic field, the legal-ethical, and the sociopolitical field. Our account emphasizes that biobanks are not technical visions that operate vis-à-vis an external society. The article discusses attempts to develop participatory governance structures. It concludes that facilitating and managing the integration of a network of more or less interrelated actors, in many nonhierarchic ways, should not be equated with democratization per se, but can nevertheless be regarded as an important step towards a more pluralistic and inclusive style of policy making.",,,

To capture the degree of complexity, specialization, and diversity that exists among human research biobanks, we propose here a new classification schema achieved using a conceptual classification approach. This schema is based on 4 functional biobank  elements  (donor/participant, design, biospecimens, and brand), which we feel are most important to the major stakeholder groups (public/participants, members of the biobank community, health care professionals/researcher users, sponsors/funders, and oversight bodies), and multiple intrinsic features or  subelements  (eg, the element  biospecimens  could be further classified based on preservation method into fixed, frozen, fresh, live, and desiccated).

The willingness to donate samples of blood (82.5%) and skin (58.7%) is high among the population analyzed and seems to be largely independent of any expense allowance. People working in the healthcare system, dermatological patients, and higher qualified individuals seem to be in particular willing to donate material.

It is thus unsurprising then that there has been a lively debate as to how biobanks should operate, the boundaries of participation and what governance structure, if any they should adopt, a debate which has been engaged in across the academic community and by funders and researchers alike. This paper asks despite the good intentions can ad hoc ethics and ethics and governance committees long term provide an effective solution to the legal and regulatory challenges arising from biobanks.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Confidentiality;Ethics Committees, Research;Genetic Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Social Responsibility;United Kingdom"

This study held focus groups (n = 7) with 48 individuals residing in the catchment of an emerging comprehensive tissue and DNA biobank in the state of Iowa. Participants recognized benefits of bringing CABs into biobank oversight, including additional levels of protection they could afford research participants. Yet, CAB goals of protecting participants were also seen as potentially antithetical to research and medical progress. Participants expressed uncertainty about the relationship of CABs to IRBs, communities, and industry. Findings suggest members of the public are in principle supportive of CAB involvement in biobanking, yet anticipate a range of problems and concerns.

To this end, a qualitative study was conducted to assess community member knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and informational needs about cancer-related biospecimen collection in a large metropolitan area in southwest Florida. The study utilized purposive sampling techniques to recruit a total of 95 participants to participate in 12 focus groups, segmented by race/ethnicity and language preference (mixed race, African American only, and Spanish speaking) and age (18-29, 30-54, and 55 and older). Focus group interviews were analyzed using content analysis to identify emergent themes. Overall, participants in the 30 years and older groups were favorable toward participating in biobanking if their concerns were addressed, such as confidentiality and consent issues, in contrast to participants aged 18-29 who were more skeptical. For all participants, the desire to participate in research that seeks new cancer treatments outweighed mistrust. Moreover, many cited the potential scientific benefit for future generations as a primary motivator. Finally, in some groups a therapeutic misconception was expressed, where participants expressed a willingness to forego confidentiality of their health status in exchange for therapeutic benefit.

The fast progression of biobanks around the world is becoming an important resource for society where the patient benefit is in the focus, with a high degree of personal integrity and ethical standard. Biobanks are providing patient benefits by large scale screening studies, generating large database repositories. It is envisioned by all participating stakeholders that the biobank initiatives will become the future gateway to discover new frontiers within life science and patient care. There is a great importance of biobank establishment globally, as biobanks has been identified as a key area for development in order to speed up the discovery and development of new drugs and protein biomarker diagnostics. One of the major objectives in Europe is to establish concerted actions, where biobank networks are being developed in order to combine and have the opportunity to share and build new science and understanding from complex disease biology.

The paper falls in three parts. The first part is a brief explication of the philosophical justification of the right to withdraw. The second part presents a number of extant criticisms of the right.

This paper considers the different ways in which biobanks have attempted to engage and appeal to their publics and the reaction of potential and actual donors.

These requirements, it argues, are limited to provision of adequate information and non-coercion. While neither of these is in itself negligible, this is a smaller set of demands than is often suggested. In particular, it is argued here that securing 'one time consent' is consistent with respect for autonomy.

While not comprehensive, this article offers an overview of the human aspects of biobanking from the viewpoint of biobank personnel-from biobank formation, through the process, and in addressing post-biobanking issues. As every biobank and biobank network may differ, such factors may vary. Before biobanking can commence, the purpose of the biobank network must be defined, and buy-in achieved from many stakeholders. An attitude of trust and sharing is essential, as is good communication. Developing a biobank is time consuming and laborious. Forming a network requires significantly more time due to the need for cross-institutional harmonization of policies, procedures, information technology considerations, and ethics. Circumstances may dictate whether development occurs top-down and/or bottom-up, as well as whether network management may be independent or by personnel from participating biobanks. Funding tends to be a prominent issue for biobanks and networks alike. In particular, networks function optimally with some level of government support, particularly for personnel. Quality biospecimen collection involves meticulously documented coordination with a network of medical and nursing staff. Examining and sampling operative specimens requires timely collaboration between the surgical and pathology teams.  Catch rates  for samples may be difficult to predict and may occur at a frequency less than anticipated due to factors related to the institution, staff, or specimen. These factors may affect specimen quality, and have a downstream effect on competition for specimens for research. Thus, release of samples requires a fair, carefully constructed sample access policy, usually incorporating an incentive for researchers, and an encouragement to form collaborations. Finally, the public and patient groups should aim to understand the benefits of a biobank network, so that patient care is improved through coordinated biobanking activity.",,,

It first exemplifies an 'institution shaped gap' in the current field of biobanking ethics. Next the biobank is conceptualized as a social institution that is apt for a certain kind of purposive functional definition such that we know it by what it does and what it is designed to do. This purpose is then characterized further as essentially incorporating the human goods the institution is designed to serve, such that it plays a useful and indispensible role in how it should operate, i.e. in the ethics and governance of biobanking. Finally the ethical scope and limitations of such a theory is clarified by a discussion of some theoretical objections and suggested practical examples of its application.",,,"Bioethical Issues;Biological Specimen Banks;Ethics, Institutional;Humans"

In spite of expectation given by biobanks in medicine, their management involved some ethical questions, for example, the need for policies to regulate economic interests, potential commercial use of data (including patents), private sector financing, ownership of samples and benefit sharing. In the context of contributing to the general public interest, we can consider the act of giving biological material to biobanks as a donation, in which the donation constitutes part of a generalised form of reciprocity in which the act of donation contributes to society's common good. Starting from this perspective, we move into a different situation represented by the biobanking of umbilical cord blood for personal use. We used the example of the private biobanking of umbilical cords to demonstrate the restrictive utility of the collection and preservation of cord blood for personal use in private biobanks, in the context of society's common good.

We argue that the existing data originate in a relatively few regions, among them Northern Europe, the United Kingdom, and in certain U.S. states and are often based on survey research with small samples and short questionnaires. Combined usage of qualitative and quantitative methodology in studies is still rare though of great importance in order to investigate distributions of public opinion and also to be able to explain these patterns.

An example of this is UK Biobank which has developed and operates according to an Ethics and Governance Framework. Such an instrument has no basis in law and yet it has played a crucial role in the set up and ongoing management of the resource. It will continue to do so, as related policies emerge, such as access and intellectual property policies. Numerous biobanking initiatives have similar high-level policy documents that guide decisions and practice. These are often framed as a commitment to participants, researchers and society more broadly and invoke notions such as the public good and the public interest. As such, they serve as a benchmark against which to measure a biobank's performance. Moreover, policies become an important means by which biobankers are held accountable. This article critically analyses this policy-driven phenomenon asking how effectively policy--often as an alternative to law--serves to police and to promote biobanking.

The social and ethical challenges associated with the implementation and operation of biobanks are equally well-documented. One of the proposed solutions to these challenges involves trading off a reduction in the specificity of informed consent protocols with an increased emphasis on governance. However, little work has gone into formulating what such governance might look like. In this paper, we suggest four general principles that should inform biobank governance and illustrate the enactment of these principles in a proposed governance model for a particular population-scale biobank, the British Columbia (BC) Generations Project. We begin by outlining four principles that we see as necessary for informing sustainable and effective governance of biobanks: (1) recognition of research participants and publics as a collective body, (2) trustworthiness, (3) adaptive management, and (4) fit between the nature of a particular biobank and the specific structural elements of governance adopted. Using the BC Generations Project as a case study, we then offer as a working model for further discussion the outlines of a proposed governance structure enacting these principles. Ultimately, our goal is to design an adaptive governance approach that can protect participant interests as well as promote effective translational health sciences.",,,"British Columbia;Community Participation;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Research;Genome;Humans;Informed Consent;Trust"

Formerly centered on the investigation of single-gene disorders, genetic research is increasingly targeting common complex diseases and in doing so is studying the whole genome, the environment and its impact on genomic variation. Consequently, biobanking initiatives have emerged around the world as a tool to sustain such progress. Whether they are small scale or longitudinal, public or private, commercial or non-commercial, biobanks should consider the possibility of closure. Interestingly, while raising important ethical issues, this topic has hardly been explored in the literature. Indeed, ethical issues associated with sale, insolvency, end of funding, or transfer of materials to other entities (which are all issues either related to or possible consequences of closure) are seldom the subject of discussion. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper will discuss-using population and direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies' biobanks as case studies-(1) international and national normative documents addressing the issue of closure and (2) the internal policies of population biobanks and DTC genetic testing companies.

Approaches to personalized medicine require a new model system for functional and pharmacogenomic studies of a variety of accumulating genetic variations, as well as new research environments such as biobankomics. Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) will provide a valuable tool to meet such new demands in the biobankomics era. The National Biobank of Korea (NBK), which is leading the Korea Biobank Project, has a large collection of LCLs derived mostly from population-based cohort samples. Using a special long-term subculture collection of NBK LCLs, biological characteristics of early passage LCLs and terminally immortalized LCLs have been investigated to promote the utilization of LCLs and provide well quality-controlled LCLs for genetic and pharmacogenomic studies. As LCLs have been successfully phenotyped for cytotoxicity in response to various stimulators, including chemotherapeutic agents, environmental chemicals and irradiation, the utility of LCLs will increase in the future.

We analyzed the type of published articles, journals publishing them, involvement of countries/institutions, year of publication, and citations received, and qualitatively assessed every article in order to identify ethical issues addressed by the majority of published research on human biobanking. Hundred and fifty four studies satisfied our review criteria. The studies mainly came from highly developed countries and were all published in the last two decades, with over half of them published in 2009 or 2010.

Critical components of these investments include the technological and human capital factors rooted in human specimen biobanking, which can be considered foundational to driving post genomic scientific and medical research. Their importance to cancer research, information-based medicine, and quality of health care are becoming increasingly recognized by pharmaceutical companies, non profit foundations, academic researchers, and government research agencies. However, the failure to standardize tissue collection, handling, processing, and preservation so that data can be directly compared between specimen sets, as well as insufficient leveraging of the highest quality tissue samples and associated data across an array of research needs, have strained economies of scale for the biobanking field. Although existing biobanks for private research contribute economic benefits to stakeholders that can be easily substantiated, little has been published to demonstrate the positive outcomes generated from the use, application, and dissemination of their resources more broadly. Through the use of analogous examples, this article presents a rationale for how standardization and consolidation of biobanking resources would contribute to the realization of budget savings, cost avoidances, process efficiencies, and other financial impacts to both the research community and the public.

Often these are multimillion dollar operations, yet despite these sizable investments, the economics of biobanking initiatives is not well understood. Fundamental business principles must be applied to the development and operation of such resources to ensure their long-term sustainability and maximize their impact. The true costs of developing and maintaining operations, which may have a variety of funding sources, must be better understood. Among the issues that must be considered when building a biobank economic model are: understanding the market need for the particular type of biobank under consideration and understanding and efficiently managing the biobank's  value chain,  which includes costs for case collection, tissue processing, storage management, sample distribution, and infrastructure and administration. By using these value chain factors, a Total Life Cycle Cost of Ownership (TLCO) model may be developed to estimate all costs arising from owning, operating, and maintaining a large centralized biobank. The TLCO approach allows for a better delineation of a biobank's variable and fixed costs, data that will be needed to implement any cost recovery program.

Biobanks have, however, been a source of debate in both bioethics and sociology. In recent years this theorising has been supplemented with empirical research, including a significant body of qualitative research, into donors' experiences and attitudes. To date, this literature has not been synthesised. We report the findings of a review of qualitative literature regarding the ways in which lay people construct and experience the process of donation to biobanks. Our aim was to determine what the qualitative research literature tells us about the process of donating to biobanks, and how this can enrich existing insights from quantitative research and from theoretical sociology and bioethics. Qualitative research shows that donation to biobanks is a complex process shaped by donors' embeddedness in a number of social contexts; by complex relations of trust in biomedicine; and by the ambiguous status of human tissue. While these findings are theoretically and practically useful, current sociological theorising is very general. A more detailed and nuanced 'sociology of biobanking' is needed, and this might be best achieved by exploring specific theoretical questions in a variety of biobanking settings.",,,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Qualitative Research;Tissue Banks;Tissue and Organ Procurement;Trust"

Public opinion data can help shape efforts to develop ethically sound and publicly trusted mechanisms for informing and consenting prospective biobank donors. The purpose of this study was to explore public perspectives toward a range of consent models currently being used or considered for use among comprehensive US biobanks. The study used an exploratory mixed-methods design, using focus groups and telephone surveys. Eligible participants were English-speaking residents in the catchment area of a comprehensive biobank being developed at the University of Iowa. Forty-eight participants in seven focus groups and 751 survey participants were recruited. Biobanks were unfamiliar to almost all study participants but were seen as valuable resources. Most focus group (63%) and survey (67%) participants preferred a prospective opt-in over an opt-out consent approach. Broad, research-unspecific consent was preferred over categorical and study-specific consent models for purposes of approving future research use. Many individuals may want to make an active and informed choice at the point of being approached for biobank participation but are prepared to consent broadly to future research use and to forego additional choices as a result.",,,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Focus Groups;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Mental Competency;Middle Aged;Public Opinion;United States"

They are an invaluable resource for the study of the development, health and behaviour of children. International norms for the management of adult biobanks exist, but paediatric biobanks require distinct policies to account for the needs of children, their general incapacity, and their intellectual development throughout the life of the biobank. Because of their particular nature we revisit the issues of consent, the return of research results, and privacy, and discuss how each could be modulated in the paediatric context. We recognize that such modifications entail further financial and logistical complications but maintain that it is essential that paediatric biobanks consider these issues and adapt their biobanks management policies accordingly, rather than extrapolate the current adult-based norms and jeopardise the rights of child participants.",,,Adolescent;Biological Specimen Banks;Child;Confidentiality;Humans;Informed Consent;Parental Consent;Parents;Pediatrics;

For this purpose, health authorities and national research institutes in France have provided significant support for the set up of biobanks. The present work was conducted to describe how we set up a biobank targeting diseases of a specific organ (thyroid gland), with the aim of rapidly developing translational research projects. The prospective experience of a single institution (Pasteur Hospital, Nice, France) over a 6-year period (2004-2009) is presented from the practical point of view of a surgical pathology laboratory. We describe different procedures required to obtain high-quality thyroid biological resources and clinical annotations. The procedures were established for the management of biological products obtained from 1454 patients who underwent thyroid surgery. The preanalytical steps leading to the storage of frozen specimens were carried out in parallel with diagnostic procedures. As the number of international networks for research programs using biological products is steadily increasing, it is crucial to harmonize the procedures used by biobanks. In this regard, the described thyroid biobank has been set up using criteria established by the French National Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer) to guarantee the quality of different collections stored in biobanks.",,,

Biospecimen research is a fast developing field that will improve biobanking methodology and biobanking is becoming more professionally organized with increased attention to quality management. Biobank networks are developing rapidly in order to combine and share resources. Biobanking services must improve rapidly to serve the needs of personalized medicine and biospecimen research should be encouraged and supported at all levels from project funding to publication of results. Biobanks need to be run to high professional standards and the importance of adequate funding, training and certification must be emphasized.

In addition to storage facilities, a biobank may comprise a complete organization with biological samples, data, personnel, policies, and procedures for handling specimens and performing other services, such as the management of the database and the planning of scientific studies. This combination of facilities, policies, and processes may also be called a biological resource center (BRC) ( www.iarc.fr ). Research using specimens from biobanks is regulated by European Union (EU) recommendations (Recommendations on Research on Human Biological Materials. The draft recommendation on research on human biological materials was approved by CDBI at its plenary meeting on 20 October 2005) and by voluntary best practices from the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) ( http://biospecimens.cancer.gov ) and other organizations.

There must be a system for database management that can obtain data on clinical endpoints, vital status, and additional required information via registry linkages. There must be an appropriate ethical system for handling consent for research use. There should be an active effort to optimize the usefulness of clinical biobanks also for research use. Major steps in this direction include measures to stop the ongoing discarding of old samples, reformatting to minimize pick-up times, external quality assurance and formal accreditation of biobanks, building of a dedicated high-quality database that is regularly used for registry linkages, and considerations on whether usefulness and accessibility for research can be optimized by extended saving or pre-treatment of samples.

One will for obvious reasons find inconsistencies in terminology and differences in procedures suggested for biobank research among all those guidelines, emanating from many different moral and legal traditions. A central question is whether this constitutes a threat to making progress in international biobank research, as some have argued. In this book, Chapter 1 suggests that there are sufficient and well-established instruments and ethical principles available to guide research in this area. Basically I argue that there is no need for a top-down superstructure of detailed rules and guidelines to be imposed on biobank researchers. With the existing ethical review boards (ERBs) playing a central role guided by well-established ethical guidelines (e.g., the Helsinki Declaration) and solutions to specific ethical problems suggested in the literature, self-regulation by researchers providing arguments for balancing of interests in association with different research initiatives and protocols will be sufficient. Traditional information and consent procedures suffice and data protection implies a sovereign right of the individual citizen to grant the use of biobank material and personal data that is needed for biobank research. Clearly, there may still be inconsistencies in terminology when researchers of different nationalities meet in common enterprises, but both they and the ERBs are well equipped to sort out what is actually meant and propose different instruments for, for example, coding following recently established nomenclatures. The existing ERBs should play the key role, guided by the sound argumentation of the researchers in their applications to the board.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Informed Consent;

Different models of consent have been proposed to answer some of these challenges. This paper contributes to this discussion by considering the meaning and value of consent to participants in biobanks. Empirical data from a qualitative study is used to provide a participant view of the consent process and to demonstrate that, despite limited understanding of the research, consent provides the research participants with some level of control and a form of self determination that they value. Participation is framed as a moral act of a responsible citizen providing reinforcement of self identity. Consent symbolizes the trust invested in researchers and research institutions to use the biobank for the public good. The paper argues that consent continues to play an important role in biobank participation and that a participant view should inform proposals to modify consent processes.",,,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Neoplasms;Research Subjects"

A lack of high quality biosamples both stalls projects and limits research advances. In this study, we targeted a wide audience of University of California (UC) biobanking stakeholders who were either involved with the collection or the utilization of biosamples to assess the scope of their biobanking activities and their interest in virtual biobanking or cooperating in the formation of the UC-wide biorepository. Each institutional review board from the five UC medical campuses' provided a dataset of potential researchers involved with biobanking. Once identified, a brief six item web-based questionnaire was administered electronically to these researchers. Most survey participants (80%) responded  yes  (n = 348) that they were actively collecting biosamples for research, and 68% of participants indicated they would either definitely (30%, n = 131) or maybe (38%, n = 166) request biosample materials now or within the next year. An equal proportion of participants responded yes (42% or n = 184) and maybe (42% or n = 182) when asked if they would voluntarily contribute specimens to a UC-wide virtual biobank. The results presented above show high levels of support among UC biobanking stakeholders for both requesting material from and contributing material to a UC-wide virtual biobank.

There is a need to increase participation in biobanking among ethnic and racial minorities. The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to identify factors that may influence Mexican-American individuals' willingness to participate in biobanking. We conducted 15 focus groups in three Texas cities with Mexican-American individuals, in both Spanish and English. Lack of knowledge about medical research and biobanks, lack of information about the specifics of biobanking participation, lack of communication of the results, fear of pain or harm, and distrust of the healthcare system or health research were identified as barriers to biobanking participation. Facilitators to participation were altruism, safety, understanding biobanking procedures and purposes, perceived benefits to participation, and culturally appropriate recruitment strategies. Although Mexican-Americans living in Texas are willing to donate biospecimens for altruistic reasons, such as helping society or advancing science, they want more information about what biobanking entails. They want to be assured that participation will not cause them harm and that the research is conducted with good intentions.

Our research focuses on the retention of data and biological materials obtained from children. However important such paediatric biobanks may be, the privacy interests of the children involved and the related risks may not be ignored. The privacy issues arising from paediatric biobanks are the central focus of this article. We first review the international regulations that apply to biobanks and then summarise viewpoints expressed by experts in a round-table discussion. We confine ourselves here to two normative questions: (1) How much control should children's parents or legal representatives, and later the children themselves, have over the stored materials and data? (2) What should be done if research findings emerge that have serious implications for a child's health? On the basis of international legal standards and the views of experts, involved in paediatric biobanking, we argue that biological material of children may only be stored in a biobank for scientific purposes if parents provide their explicit consent, the child is re-contacted at 16 or 18 years of age to reconsider storage and use of its material, and the biobank maintains a limited policy in disclosure of individual research findings to the child's parents. What is Known: • Increasingly, biological material of children is stored in biobanks for research purposes. • Clear standards on the conditions under which children's cells or tissues may be stored and used are lacking. What is New: • According to experts, storage and use of children's materials should only be allowed if performed in accordance with appropriate consent procedures and feedback policies.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Child;Confidentiality;Humans;Informed Consent;Netherlands;Parents;Patient Rights;Biobank;Biological material;Children;Individual findings;Informed consent;Re-contacting;

The issues and cost of irreproducibility has mainly been published on pre-clinical research. In contrast to pre-clinical research, test material is often being transferred into humans in clinical research. To protect treated human subjects and guarantee a defined quality standard in the field of clinical research, the manufacturing and processing infrastructures have to strictly follow and adhere to certain (inter-)national quality standards. It is assumed and suggested by the authors that by an implementation of certain quality standards within the area of pre-clinical research, billions of USD might be saved and the translation phase of promising pre-clinical results towards clinical applications may substantially be improved. In this review, we discuss how an implementation of a quality assurance (QA) management system might positively improve sample quality and sustainability within pre-clinically focused biobank infrastructures. Biobanks are frequently positioned at the very beginning of the biomedical research value chain, and, since almost every research material has been stored in a biobank during the investigated life cycle, biobanking seems to be of substantial importance from this perspective.

In this paper we provide guidance on how to put personalized assent into pediatric biobanking practice and consider both the content and process of personalized assent. In the discussion we argue that the assent procedure itself is formative. Investing in the procedure should be a requirement for pediatric biobank research. Although personalized assent will require certain efforts, the pediatric (biobank) community must be aware of its importance.

Of those classified as  probable  type 2 diabetes, 75% and 96% had specific type 2 diabetes codes in their primary and secondary care records. For incidence, 95% of people with the type 2 diabetes-specific C10F Read code in primary care had corroborative evidence of diabetes from medications, blood testing or diabetes specific process of care codes. Only 41% of people identified with type 2 diabetes in primary care had secondary care evidence of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, of incident cases using ICD-10 type 2 diabetes specific codes in secondary care, 77% had corroborative evidence of diabetes in primary care. We suggest our definition of prevalent diabetes from UK Biobank baseline data has external validity, and recommend that specific primary care Read codes should be used for incident diabetes to ensure precision. Secondary care data should be used for incident diabetes with caution, as around half of all cases are missed, and a quarter have no corroborative evidence of diabetes in primary care.",,,"Aged;Algorithms;Biological Specimen Banks;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Female;Humans;Incidence;Male;Middle Aged;Prevalence;United Kingdom"
490,The role of biobanks in elucidating prevalent genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia.,"Adila Salih ElObeid,Ibrahim AlAbdudlkarim",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27594298/,"Biobanking entails large-scale collection of human biological specimens that are linked to the donors' health and personal information, and has several applications in clinical research. Human biological specimens, such as blood, urine and tissue, have become immensely important to medical research: they offer a valuable source of genetic material that researchers can use to identify disease-associated genetic variation and to determine interactions between genes and environmental factors. Identification of genetic contributions to disease can lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and targeted treatments. Over the last decade, both common diseases and rare genetic disorders have been reported in Saudi Arabia. The need to generate extensive genetic data on these diseases has led to the establishment of several Saudi Arabian biobanks. Fortunately, these vital efforts have the support of the Saudi Government and researchers. However, the success of any biobank also requires public support and the willingness of the population to donate their biological material along with information on their medical records. Thus, the Saudi public needs to be informed of the benefits of maintaining biobanks, their participation needs to be encouraged through donation of biological material, and any public concerns regarding the confidential treatment of medical data need to be addressed. This article reviews the most common genetic diseases identified in the Saudi population, it describes biobanks and it examines how biobanks can support biomedical research in the area. Moreover, this article proposes measures that might help to increase public awareness of biobanks and the preparedness of the Saudi Arabian population to donate biological material.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Consanguinity;Genetic Diseases, Inborn;History, 20th Century;History, 21st Century;Humans;Islam;Patient Education as Topic;Patient Selection;Saudi Arabia;Tissue Donors;Tissue and Organ Procurement"

Erythroid precursor cells were obtained from 72 patients, mostly β-thalassemic, expanded and cryopreserved. Expression of globin genes was analyzed by real time RT-qPCR. Hemoglobin production was studied by HPLC. In this paper we describe the production and validation of a Thal-Biobank constituted by expanded erythroid precursor cells from β-thalassemia patients. The biobanked samples were validated for maintenance of their phenotype after (a) cell isolation from same patients during independent phlebotomies, (b) freezing step in different biobanked cryovials, (c) thawing step and analysis at different time points. Reproducibility was confirmed by shipping the frozen biobanked cells to different laboratories, where the cells were thawed, cultured and analyzed using the same standardized procedures. The biobanked cells were stratified on the basis of their baseline level of fetal hemoglobin production and exposed to fetal hemoglobin inducers. The use of biobanked cells allows stratification of the patients with respect to fetal hemoglobin production and can be used for determining the response to the fetal hemoglobin inducer hydroxyurea and to gene therapy protocols with reproducible results.",,,"Antigens, CD34;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Cell Differentiation;Cells, Cultured;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cryopreservation;Erythroid Precursor Cells;Erythropoietin;Fetal Hemoglobin;Hemoglobins;Humans;Kinetics;RNA, Messenger;Reproducibility of Results;beta-Thalassemia;Biobanking;Gene therapy;HbF induction;Thalassemia"

(Bio-) medical ontologies like Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology (ORDO) or the Human Disease Ontology (DOID) provide a high number of concepts, synonyms and entity relationship properties. Such standard terminologies increase quality and granularity of input data by adding comprehensive semantic background knowledge from validated entity relationships. Moreover, cross-references between terminology concepts facilitate data integration across databases using different coding standards. In order to encourage the use of standard terminologies, our aim is to identify and link relevant concepts with free-text diagnosis inputs within a biobank registry. Relevant concepts are selected automatically by lexical matching and SPARQL queries against a RDF triplestore. To ensure correctness of annotations, proposed concepts have to be confirmed by medical data administration experts before they are entered into the registry database. Relevant (bio-) medical terminologies describing diseases and phenotypes were identified and stored in a graph database which was tied to a local biobank registry.

Rising demand and the need for higher quality biospecimens are already evident. The recent increase in requirement for biospecimen complexity in terms of linked biospecimen types, multiple preservation formats, and longitudinal data was explored by assessing trends in cancer research publications from 2000 to 2014. A PubMed search shows that there has been an increase in both raw numbers and the relative proportion (adjusted for total numbers of articles in each period) of the subgroups of articles typically associated with the use of biospecimens and both dense treatment and/or outcomes data and multiple biospecimen formats. Increasing biospecimen complexity is a largely unrecognized and new pressure on cancer research biobanks. New approaches to cancer biospecimen resources are needed such as the implementation of more efficient and dynamic consent mechanisms, stronger participant involvement in biobank governance, development of requirements for registration of collections, and models to establish stock targets for biobanks. In particular, the latter two approaches would enable funders to establish a better balance between biospecimen supply and research demand, reduce expenditure on duplicate collections, and encourage increased efficiency of biobanks to respond to the research need for more complex cases. This in turn would also enable biobanks to focus more on quality and standardization that are surely factors in the even more important arena of research reproducibility. .",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Neoplasms;PubMed;Specimen Handling;Translational Research, Biomedical"

The most commonly used method is blanket-or broad-consent where donors allow their donation to be used for any future research approved by the biobank. This approach does not account for the fact that some donors may have moral concerns about the uses of their biospecimens. This problem can be avoided using  real-time -or study-by-study-consent, but this policy places a significant burden on biobanks. In order to better understand the public's preferences regarding biobank consent policy, we surveyed a sample that was representative of the population of the United States. Respondents were presented with 5 biobank consent policies and were asked to indicate which policies were acceptable/unacceptable and to identify the best/worst policies. They were also given 7 research scenarios that could create moral concern (e.g. research intending to make abortions safer and more effective) and asked how likely they would be to provide broad consent knowing that their donation might be used in that research. Substantial minorities found both broad and study-by-study consent to be unacceptable and identified those two options as the worst policies. Furthermore, while the type of moral concern (e.g., regarding abortion, the commercial use of donations, or stem cell research) had no effect on policy preferences, an increase in the number of research scenarios generating moral concerns was related to an increased likelihood of finding broad consent to be the worst policy. The rejection of these ethically problematic and costly extremes is good news for biobanks. The challenge now is to design a policy that combines consent with access to information in a way that assures potential donors that their interests and moral concerns are being respected.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Informed Consent;Privacy;Tissue Donors;United States;

We undertook a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the unique UK Biobank resource (n=502 649). RA was based on self-report, and type of medication was used as a proxy measure of valid diagnosis. Participants with and without RA were compared in terms of sociodemographic, lifestyle and other disease-related risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to determine whether participants with RA were more likely to report comorbid conditions, and whether this varied by RA severity. The models were adjusted for potential confounders and lifestyle risk factors. At baseline, 5657 (1.13%) eligible UK Biobank participants reported RA of whom 2849 (0.57%) had medically treated RA (median duration=10 years). Prevalence was significantly higher among female, South Asian and socioeconomically deprived participants.

Further investigations in this respect may allow communication procedures tailored to participants' needs. Based on the Italian Twin Registry, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among twins who had not yet donated biological samples for research. The objective was to assess the importance these potential donors attributed to specific procedures and pieces of communication related to research biobanking. A self-administered questionnaire was constructed and validated. Items were as follows: potential agreement on use of biological samples for research; knowledge of biobanks; and importance given to privacy protection and to communication of general and individual tests results, study objectives, type and amount of participant involvement, location and duration of sample storage, and benefits and potential risks. Multivariate analysis was performed to estimate the association of these items with sociodemographic factors as well as with perceived health status and chronic or long-term diseases. The questionnaire was mailed to 4894 twins aged 18-65 (response rate 34%). One-third of subjects already knew about biobanks, 52% had some knowledge, and 20% were uninformed. A majority expressed unconditional agreement to sample use for research. Only 6% of respondents considered privacy protection not important in research biobanking. Knowledge of biobanks predicted attention to most of the issues. Higher education was associated with more frequent concern about type and amount of involvement, but less frequent concern about place and time of storage, and presence of benefits. Women were more attentive to research biobanking. This study supports the need of procedures tailored on different donors' concerns and highlights the social value of population biobanks.

511,Pre-storage centrifugation conditions have significant impact on measured microRNA levels in biobanked EDTA plasma samples.,"Helle Glud Binderup,Kim Houlind,Jonna Skov Madsen,Claus Lohman Brasen",,,,,2016,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28955906/," In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have reported the potential use of microRNAs (miRNA) as circulating biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis of a wide variety of diseases. There is, however, a lack of reproducibility between studies. Due to the high miRNA content in platelets this may partly be explained by residual platelets in the plasma samples used. When collecting fresh plasma samples, it is possible to produce cell-free/platelet-poor plasma by centrifugation. In this study, we systematically investigated whether biobanked EDTA plasma samples could be processed to be suitable for miRNA analysis. Blood samples were collected from ten healthy volunteers and centrifuged to produce platelet-poor-plasma (PPP) and standard biobank plasma. After one week at -80 °C the biobanked EDTA plasma was re-centrifuged by different steps to remove residual platelets. Using RT-qPCR the levels of 14 miRNAs in the different plasma preparations were compared to that of PPP. We were able to remove residual platelets from biobanked EDTA plasma by re-centrifugation of the thawed samples. Nevertheless, for most of the investigated miRNAs, the miRNA level was significantly higher in the re-centrifuged biobanked plasma compared to PPP, even when the platelet count was reduced to 0-1×10/L. We found, that pre-storage centrifugation conditions have a significant impact on the measured EDTA plasma level of miRNAs known to be present in platelets. Even for the miRNAs found to be less effected, we showed that a 1.5-3 fold change in plasma levels may possible be caused by or easily overseen due to sample preparation and/or storage.",,,"Biobanking;Centrifugation;MicroRNA;PPP, platelet-poor-plasma;Preanalytical conditions;RT-qPCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;Residual platelets;°C, degrees Celcius"

Although few have enacted biobank-specific legislation, many countries address biobanking within other laws. All provide for some oversight mechanisms for biobank research, even though the nature of that oversight varies between jurisdictions. Most have some sort of controlled access system in place for research with biobank specimens. While broad consent models facilitate biobanking, countries without national or federated biobanks have been slow to adopt broad consent. International guidelines have facilitated sharing and generally take a proportional risk approach, but many countries have provisions guiding international sharing and a few even limit international sharing. Although privacy laws may not prohibit international collaborations, the multi-prong approach to privacy unique to each jurisdiction can complicate international sharing. These symposium issues can serve as a resource for explaining the sometimes intricate privacy laws in each studied jurisdiction, outlining the key issues with regards to privacy and biobanking, and serving to describe a framework for the process of harmonization of privacy laws.",,,Access to Information;Biological Specimen Banks;Confidentiality;Humans;Privacy;

Neither rule, however, was created to function in the unique context of biobank research, and therefore neither applies to all biobank-based research. Not only is it challenging to determine when the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the Common Rule apply, but these laws apply different standards to protect privacy. In addition, many other federal and state laws may be applicable to a particular biobank, researcher, or project. US law also does not directly address international sharing of data or specimens outside of the EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement, which only applies to receipt of data by certain US entities from EU countries, and is in the process of revision. Although new rules would help clarify privacy protections in biobanking, any implemented changes should be studied to determine the sufficiency of the protections as well as its ability to facilitate or hinder international collaborations.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Confidentiality;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act;Humans;Privacy;United States;

In addition, Mexican law singles out genetic research in informed consent provisions, but it does not specify whether all biobank-based research is genetic research.

Our analysis found differences in the range of researchers and organizations eligible to access biobanks; application processes; requirements for Research Ethics Committee approval; and terms of Material Transfer Agreements relating to ownership and commercialization. However, the main elements of access are the same across biobanks; access will be granted to bona fide researchers conducting research in the public interest, and all biobanks will consider the scientific merit of the proposed use and it's compatibility with the biobank's objectives. These findings suggest potential areas for harmonization across biobanks. This could be achieved through a single centralized application to a number of biobanks or a system of mutual recognition that places a presumption in favor of access to one biobank if already approved by another member of the same consortium.

Ontologies have been demonstrated to be a promising approach in fostering better semantic integration of biobank-related data. Hitherto no ontology provided the coverage needed to capture a broad spectrum of biobank user scenarios. Based in the principles laid out by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry two biobanking ontologies have been developed. These two ontologies were merged using a modular approach consistent with the initial development principles. The merging was facilitated by the fact that both ontologies use the same Upper Ontology and re-use classes from a similar set of pre-existing ontologies. Based on the two previous ontologies the Ontology for Biobanking (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obib.owl) was created. Due to the fact that there was no overlap between the two source ontologies the coverage of the resulting ontology is significantly larger than of the two source ontologies. The ontology is successfully used in managing biobank information of the Penn Medicine BioBank.

This might undermine the protection of sample donors, complicate networked biobank research, create research waste and impact on public trust. A systematic analysis of international research guidelines and existing broad consent templates was performed. Based on this information an interdisciplinary expert group from the AKMEK (Permanent Working Party of German RECs) developed a draft template and organized a comprehensive stakeholder consultation. After revision the final template was consented by all 53 German RECs. This paper briefly explores the spectrum of potentially relevant issues for broad consent forms. It then elaborates the template and how it was designed to be applicable in different types of biobanks. To further improve the validity and applicability of broad consent forms in biobank and other big data research, practice evaluations are needed.

These measures will be used in a range of future studies of health outcomes in this cohort. The format and content of the cognitive tasks were partly novel. The aim of the present study was to validate and characterize the cognitive data: to describe the inter-correlational structure of the cognitive variables at baseline assessment, and the degree of stability in scores across longitudinal assessment. Baseline cognitive data were used to examine the inter-correlational/factor-structure, using principal components analysis (PCA). We also assessed the degree of stability in cognitive scores in the subsample of participants with repeat data. The different tests of cognitive ability showed significant raw inter-correlations in the expected directions. PCA suggested a one-factor solution (eigenvalue = 1.60), which accounted for around 40% of the variance.

We aimed to examine the relation between active commuting and obesity in mid-life using objectively measured anthropometric data from UK Biobank. Cross-sectional, observational data from UK Biobank were used. These were collected from individuals aged 40-69 years who visited 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported commuting method was operationalised into seven categories, ordered to reflect typical levels of physical exertion. The outcomes assessed were BMI (based on objectively measured weight and height) and percentage body fat. Hypothesised confounders were income, area deprivation, urban or rural residence, education, alcohol intake, smoking, leisure physical activity, recreational walking, occupational physical activity, general health, and limiting illness or disability. We used sex-stratified multivariate linear-regression models. Final complete case sample sizes were 72 999 men and 83 667 women for the BMI outcome and 72 139 men and 82 788 women for the percentage body fat outcome. Active commuting was significantly and independently associated with reduced BMI and percentage body fat for both sexes, with a graded pattern apparent across the seven commuting categories. In fully adjusted models, compared with their car-only counterparts, mixed public and active transport commuters had significantly lower BMI (men: β coefficient -1·00 kg/m(2) [95% CI -1·14 to -0·87], p<0·0001; women: -0·67 kg/m(2) [-0·86 to -0·47], p<0·0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -1·71 kg/m(2) [95% CI -1·86 to -1·56], p<0·0001; women: -1·65 kg/m(2) [-1·92 to -1·38], p<0·0001). Similarly, compared with car-only commuters, mixed public transport and active commuters had significantly lower percentage body fat (men: -1·32% [95% CI -1·53 to -1·12], p<0·0001; women: -1·10% [-1·40 to -0·81], p<0·0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -2·75% [95% CI -3·03 to -2·48], p<0·0001; women: -3·26% [-3·80 to -2·71], p<0·0001). This study is the first to use UK Biobank data to address the topic of active commuting and obesity and shows robust, independent associations between active commuting and healthier bodyweight and composition.

This type of consent ignores the evidence that some donors have moral, religious, or cultural concerns about the future uses of their donations - concerns we call  non-welfare interests . The nature of non-welfare interests and their effect on willingness to donate to a biobank is not well understood.In order to better undersand the influence of non-welfare interests, we surveyed a national sample of the US population (in June 2014) using a probability-based internet panel. Logistic regression models assessed the demographic and attitudinal characteristics associated with participants' willingness to give consent for unspecified future uses of their donation when presented with 7 research scenarios that raised possible non-welfare interest concerns. Most people had non-welfare interests that significantly affect their willingness to donate to a biobank using blanket consent. Some non-welfare interests are associated with subgroups but others are not. A positive attitude toward biomedical research in general was associated with increased willingness to donate, while concerns about privacy and being African American were associated with decreased willingness.Non-welfare interests matter and can diminish willingness to donate to a biobank.

However, the effective and efficient use of biobank resources depends on their accessibility. In fact, making bio-resources promptly accessible to everybody may increase the benefits for society. Furthermore, optimizing their use and ensuring their quality will promote scientific creativity and, in general, contribute to the progress of bio-medical research. Although this has become a rather common belief, several laboratories are still secretive and continue to withhold samples and data. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey in order to investigate sample and data accessibility in research biobanks operating all over the world. The survey involved a total of 46 biobanks. Most of them gave permission to access their samples (95.7%) and data (85.4%), but free and unconditioned accessibility seemed not to be common practice. The analysis of the guidelines regarding the accessibility to resources of the biobanks that responded to the survey highlights three issues: (i) the request for applicants to explain what they would like to do with the resources requested; (ii) the role of funding, public or private, in the establishment of fruitful collaborations between biobanks and research labs; (iii) the request of co-authorship in order to give access to their data. These results suggest that economic and academic aspects are involved in determining the extent of sample and data sharing stored in biobanks.

This study aimed to reveal which issues divide different stakeholders in an attempt to determine the rights and/or obligations held on human biological materials (HBM) and data. Twenty-eight informants in the Benelux and Scandinavia were interviewed in order to capture the perspectives of experts and stakeholders in relation to the rights and obligations held by custodians and applicants with respect to access to HBM and data. There was no consensus among the informants on whether the custodian of a biobank should decide upon the scientific merits and the utility of an access request. Nearly all informants agreed that a new request or an amendment to the initial request has to be submitted when an applicant wants to use leftover HBM in a new or follow-up project. Several informants felt that it might be justified to charge higher access fees to external or industrial applicants that did not contribute (directly or indirectly) to the collection of HBM and data. Most informants agreed that a custodian of a biobank could request the sharing and return of research results. It was furthermore argued that some of the benefits of research projects should be fed back into biobanks. The interviews revealed a rather complex web of rights and obligations allocated to the custodian and the applicant in relation to access to HBM and data stored in biobanks. Some rights and obligations are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, while others are stipulated in access arrangements. We did find a consensus on the attribution of certain general rights to the custodians and the applicant.",,,Access to Information;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Qualitative Research;Scandinavian and Nordic Countries;Social Responsibility;Trust;

However, uncertainty over the presence and nature of some of these associations exists. Analysis of data from large population based studies will help to resolve these uncertainties. The QUARTZ (QUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessel Topology and siZe) retinal image analysis system allows automated processing of large numbers of retinal images. However, an image quality assessment module is needed to achieve full automation. In this paper, we propose such an algorithm, which uses the segmented vessel map to determine the suitability of retinal images for use in the creation of vessel morphometric data suitable for epidemiological studies. This includes an effective 3-dimensional feature set and support vector machine classification. A random subset of 800 retinal images from UK Biobank (a large prospective study of 500,000 middle aged adults; where 68,151 underwent retinal imaging) was used to examine the performance of the image quality algorithm. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 95.33% and a specificity of 91.13% for the detection of inadequate images. The strong performance of this image quality algorithm will make rapid automated analysis of vascular morphometry feasible on the entire UK Biobank dataset (and other large retinal datasets), with minimal operator involvement, and at low cost.",,,Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Datasets as Topic;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Male;Middle Aged;Random Allocation;Retina;Retinal Vessels;United Kingdom;Vascular Diseases;Epidemiological studies;Image quality;Large retinal datasets;Retinal image;UK Biobank;Vessel segmentation;

One hundred LBC samples with ASCUS or CIN1 were tested for HPV DNA and mRNA before and after biobanking. DNA analysis targeted the viral genes E6 and E7, 12 high-risk and 2 low-risk HPV types together with the human control gene HBB, using real-time PCR. The Aptima HPV assay was used for mRNA analysis of 14 high-risk HPV types. With Aptima there was 84% agreement between results before and after biobanking. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.88) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99), respectively. With the DNA-based method, the agreement between results was 87%, the sensitivity 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92) and the specificity 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77-1.00). Both methods presented a significant difference between positive results before and after biobanking; McNemar test: p = 0.004, p = 0.003, Cohen's kappa: 0.67 (95% CI, 0.53-0.81), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52-0.84). Cycle threshold values for the DNA method were higher for all genotypes after biobanking, except for HPV-59. Some loss of sensitivity was seen after biobanking but the concordance between HPV detection before and after biobanking was good for both evaluated methods. Biobanking of LBC vaginal samples offers a good platform for HPV testing and could be extended to further molecular analyses. However, in order to ensure a valid test result a larger portion needs to be analyzed from the biobanked sample.",,,Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Early Detection of Cancer;Female;Humans;Middle Aged;Papillomaviridae;Papillomavirus Infections;Vagina;Vaginal Smears;Young Adult;

To evaluate trends in biobanking, 20,000 bibliographic records were retrieved and analyzed between 1939 and 2014 from the Scopus database using a series of biobank-related search terms within titles and keywords. Since the 1990s, the field of biobanking has been, and still is, experiencing above-average growth in terms of publications, journals, and thematic orientations. Almost two-thirds of all indexed biobanking documents have been published in the last decade, with now >1,000 publications in 600 distinct journals per year. Around 50,000 individual authors can be identified who have so far contributed to the field of biobanking, with an average of 1.5 publications per author. Author affiliations follow an uneven distribution: 42% of the authors are based in Europe, 33% in North America, 13% in Asia, 5% in South America, 4% in Australasia, and 2% in Africa. Analyzing the most common title words revealed (as did the journals) a strong focus on blood banking, but other biospecimen types-especially seeds, cells, and tissues-have been gaining increasing weight recently. Among medical applications, transfusion dominates, followed by transplantation. While a noticeable increase in disease and especially health occurred at the beginning of the millennium, cohort and consent seem to have become high-relevance topics only in this decade. In terms of banked organisms, human dominates, followed by viruses and plants (especially represented through seed banking). A very rough estimate based on subject categories suggests that a third of all publications in biobanking focus on organisms other than humans. However, animal, fungal, and microbial biobanking are still underrepresented, especially when considering their shares in global biodiversity.",,,Bibliometrics;Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;

This article reports the outcome of an interactive, multidisciplinary session at a meeting of the European, Middle Eastern, and African Society for Biopreservation and Biobanking (ESBB) designed to encourage a 'learning-from-each-other' approach to achieve consensus on data needs and data management across biobank communities. The Enviro-Bio and ESBBperanto Working Groups of the ESBB co-organized an interactive session at the 2013 conference (Verona, Italy), presenting data associated with biobanking processes, using examples from across different fields. One-hundred-sixty (160) diverse biobank participants were provided electronic voting devices with real-time screen display of responses to questions posed during the session. The importance of data standards and robust data management was recognized across the conference cohort, along with the need to raise awareness about these issues within and across different biobank sectors. While interactive sessions require a commitment of time and resources, and must be carefully coordinated for consistency and continuity, they stimulate the audience to be pro-active and direct the course of the session. This effective method was used to gauge opinions about significant topics across different biobanking communities.

Currently, the funding of research biobanks is not uniformly regulated, mainly because of the different focuses, services and concepts. On the other hand, the samples and associated data of biobanks gain significant value over time, and therefore their long-term storage should be envisaged right from the start.The sustainability of biobank structures can be viewed from various perspectives, but financial sustainability certainly represents the most demanding challenge. The financing of biobanks can be achieved by a well-balanced model consisting of institutional resources and other funding sources such as infrastructure and research projects, complemented by reimbursement. Structural measures such as the creation of centralized biobank structures and involvement in consortia and networks contribute to the long-term use and exchange of samples across biobanks. In turn, a quality-controlled and transparent documentation of all processes and structures is required, which guarantees the utilization of the sparse financial resources for the most efficient use of the precious resource of human biomaterial.

556,Ethically sustainable governance in the biobanking of eggs and embryos for research.,"Karla Stroud,Kieran C O'Doherty",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26712609/,"Biobanking of human tissues is associated with a range of ethical, legal, and social (ELS) challenges. These include difficulties in operationalising informed consent protocols, protecting donors' privacy, managing the return of incidental findings, conceptualising ownership of tissues, and benefit sharing. Though largely unresolved, these challenges are well documented and debated in academic literature. One common response to the ELS challenges of biobanks is a call for strong and independent governance of biobanks. Theorists who argue along these lines suggest that since fully informed consent to a single research project is often not feasible, research participants should be given the additional protection of being allowed to consent to the governance framework of the biobank. Such governance therefore needs to be transparent and ethically sustainable. In this paper we review the governance challenges of establishing and maintaining human tissue biobanks. We then discuss how the creation of a biobank for eggs and embryos, in particular, may introduce additional or unique challenges beyond those presented by the biobanking of other human tissues. Following previous work on biobank governance, we argue that ethically sustainable governance needs to be participatory, adaptive, and trustworthy.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Embryo Research;England;Ethics, Research;Humans;Oocyte Donation;Public Opinion;Stem Cell Research;Biobank;Eggs;Embryos;Governance;Public engagement;Stem cells"

At first, we briefly describe Taiwan's population, political system and health care system. Secondly, this research introduces biobanking framework of Taiwan including 25 biobanks established with the approval of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In those biobanks,  Taiwan Biobank  is the first and the largest government-supported biobank which comprises population-based cohort study and disease- oriented study. Since the collection of information, data, and biological specimen of biobanks often involve highly sensitive personal information, in the legal framework of Taiwan, there is a specific regulation,  Human Biobank Management Act  (HBMA), which plays an important role in regulating biobanks in Taiwan. HBMA, the Personal Information Act and other regulations constitute a comprehensive legal and regulatory privacy framework of biobanks. Through the introduction and analysis of the current legal framework applicable to biobanks, we found that there are several challenges that need to be solved appropriately that involve duplicate review systems, the obstacles in the international collaboration, and data sharing between biobanks in Taiwan.",,,Access to Information;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Confidentiality;Humans;Informed Consent;Taiwan;

Although the law has attempted to facilitate research by creating an opt-out regime for research with pre-existing samples, other aspects of the law hinder research. The requirement for multiple consents throughout the process of biobank sample collection and use, the lack of acceptance of a broad consent for biobanking, and genetic exceptionalism in the law all complicate biobank research. With IRB approval, opt-out consent may be used for genetic research using human tissue collected for other purposes, but express consent is still required for research with the associated genetic data.

A Draft Ordinance on Human Genetics Resources is currently being developed that will deal in more detail than previous laws with issues such as management measures, legal liability, and punishment for violations. International data sharing will be tightly regulated under this new law, and individual biobanks' policies such as the Shanghai Guidelines may choose to regulate such sharing even more.

A range of international instruments were identified, varying in substance - e.g., human rights, data protection, research ethics, biobanks, and genetics - and legal character. Some norms detail processes for broad consent, namely, that even where potential participants cannot consent to specific users and uses, they should be given clear information on access policies, procedures, and governance structures. Some also give guidance about the conditions under which secondary use of data and samples without consent is appropriate, e.g., where consent is impracticable. International norms exhibit a confusing range of terminology relating to de-identification. They also continue to rely heavily on consent and anonymity as the basis for privacy protection, though governance is becoming more prominent. It may not be fatal that such a plurality of norms apply to biobanking; what is essential is that governance be built on shared values, our common interest in the success of genomic research, and practical tools that incentivize responsible, global sharing.",,,"Access to Information;Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Privacy;Genetic Research;Humans;Informed Consent;Internationality"

Despite the development and endorsement of external quality assurance (QA) programs and biospecimen quality reporting tools, there has been little examination of relevant biobank practices. An online survey was designed to describe the use and communication of QA and quality control (QC) measures within an Australian cancer biobank cohort (n=21), classified according to access policy. Survey questions examined the development and maintenance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), other specific QA and biospecimen QC activities, and communication of biospecimen QC results to researchers. Over three quarters of biobanks utilised regularly-reviewed, best-practice-referenced SOPs, and most biobanks undertook at least one QC activity. Whereas all open-access biobanks (n=11) utilised SOPs and undertook at least one QC activity, these practices were significantly less frequent in restricted-access biobanks (n=10). There were overall low rates of recording the SPREC code, with increased but incomplete recording of Tier 1 BRISQ data. Open-access biobanks were significantly more likely to provide biospecimen QC results to researchers, and to report receiving requests for QC results or additional sample data. Improved resourcing and education may be required to boost current levels of QA and QC activities and reporting by cancer biobanks.",,,Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Cohort Studies;Humans;Neoplasms;Quality Control;BRISQ;Biobank;Biospecimen quality;Quality control;SPREC;

In this paper, we first outline the ethical challenges to informed consent and confidentiality as these apply to human biobanks, irrespective of the type of tissue being stored. We argue that the shared nature of genetic information has clear implications for informed consent, and the identifying nature of biological samples and information has clear implications for promises of confidentiality. Next, with regard to the special case of biobanking human embryos and eggs, we consider issues arising from: first, the type of tissues being stored; second, the use to which these tissues are put; and third, how this plays out given the shared and identifying nature of these tissues. Specifically, we examine the differences between human bodily tissues and human reproductive tissues focusing on the assumed potential of the reproductive tissues and on the possible greater emotional attachment to these tissues because of their real and imagined kinship. For some donors there may be a sense of family connection with embryos and eggs they once thought of as 'children-in-waiting'.

The potential value of samples and the associated data are thus not being realized. We aimed to examine whether the financing of biobanks contributes to this problem and then to propose a national solution. We combined three methods: a qualitative case study; literature analysis; and informal consultations with experts. The case study enabled an examination of the complex institutional arrangements for biobanks, with a particular focus on cost models. For the purposes of comparison, a typology for biobanks was developed using the three methods. We found that it is not possible to apply a standard cost model across the diversity of biobanks, and there is a deficit in coordination and sustainability and an excess of complexity. We propose that coordination across this diversity requires dedicated resources for a national biobanking distributed research infrastructure. A coordination center would establish and improve standards and support a national portal for access. This should be financed centrally by public funds, possibly supplemented by industrial funding. We propose that: a) sample acquisition continues to be costed into projects and project proposals to ensure biobanking is driven by research needs; b) core biobanking activities and facilities be supported by central public funds distributed directly to host public institutions; and c) marginal costs for access be paid for by the user.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Financial Management;Models, Economic;Research;Specimen Handling"

A multi-faceted view of biobanking sustainability requires consideration of operational and social sustainability in addition to the historical focus exclusively on financial sustainability. Planning and implementing this three pillar model creates a well-rounded biorepository that meets the needs of all the major stakeholders: the funders, the patients/depositors, and the researcher recipients. Often the creation of a detailed business plan is the first step to develop goals and objectives that lead down a path towards sustainability. The definition of sustainability and the complexity of a sustainable business plan may differ for each biorepository. The DNASU Plasmid Repository at Arizona State University stores and distributes DNA plasmids to researchers worldwide, and the Biobank Core Facility at St. Joseph's Hospital and Barrow Neurological Institute consents patients and collects, stores, and distributes human tissue and blood samples. We will discuss these two biorepositories, their similar and different approaches to sustainability and business planning, their challenges in creating and implementing their sustainability plan, and their responses to some of these challenges. From these experiences, the biobanks share lessons learned about planning for sustainability that are applicable to all biorepositories.",,,Academies and Institutes;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;DNA;Financial Management;Hospitals;Universities;

Current disease control strategies are hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic modalities. Therefore, novel diagnostic and prognostic tools are needed, and circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may hold potential in this area. The aims of this study were twofold: (i) to address the stability of miRNA in bovine sera from biobanked samples, and (ii) to assess the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for JD disease progression. To address these aims we used bovine sera from an experimental MAP infection model that had been stored at -20°C for over a decade, allowing us to also assess the stability of miRNA profiles in biobanked serum samples through comparison with fresh sera. Approximately 100-200 intact miRNAs were identified in each sample with 83 of these being consistently detected across all 57 samples. The miRNA profile of the biobanked sera stored at -20°C for over 10 years was highly similar to the profile of <1 year-old sera stored at -80°C, with an overlap of 73 shared miRNAs. IsomiR analysis also indicated a distinct bovine serum-specific isomiR profile as compared to previously reported bovine macrophage miRNA profiles. To explore the prognostic potential of miRNA profiles cattle defined as seropositive for anti-MAP antibodies (n = 5) were compared against seronegative cattle (n = 7). No significant differential expressed miRNAs were detected at either the early (6 months) or late (43, 46 and 49 months) intervals (FDR≤0.05, fold-change≥1.5) across seropositive or seronegative animals. However, comparing pre-infection sera to the early and late time-points identified increased miR-29a and miR-92b abundance (2-fold) that may be due to blood-cell population changes over time (P<0.001). In conclusion our study has demonstrated that bovine circulating miRNAs retain their integrity under long-term sub-optimal storage temperatures opening the way for increased miRNA analyses from biobanked samples for a range of infectious and non-infectious diseases.",,,"Animals;Antibodies, Bacterial;Biological Specimen Banks;Cattle;Female;MicroRNAs;Mycobacterium avium;Paratuberculosis"

A clear and positive attitude toward pediatric clinical and genetic research inside and outside of Saudi Arabia was found. Parental consent is viewed as essential, with 60% saying parental consent is sufficient for children up to 12, and 40% saying it is sufficient for children 12-18 years old. More than 90% of respondents preferred to gain approval from any child with a decision-making capability; 58.2 and 38.6% of them believed that children between 12 and 18, and >18 years of age, respectively, can understand and thus give their approval for genetic research. Clear majorities in the study agreed with re-consenting children when they become adults, allowing them to withdraw at any time. A clear majority agreed that either parent could sign a consent form for their child to participate in a research biobank.

High-quality cancer biospecimens are needed for robust, reproducible research findings, with most researchers obtaining these specimens from cancer biobanks or tumour banks. This review provides an overview of the types of quality control (QC) activities conducted within cancer biobanks that pertain to biospecimen quality and of biospecimen quality reporting tools, including SPREC and BRISQ. We examine how QC assay results and other biospecimen data are communicated from biobanks to researchers, and whether these activities lead to improved biospecimen quality reporting within the literature and/or to improved research outcomes. We also discuss operational factors that limit QC activities within biobanks and evidence gaps requiring further research. In summary, whereas the provision of quality biospecimens is a common aim of cancer biobanks, QC activities remain underreported and are rarely discussed in the literature, compared with other aspects of biobank operations. Further research is required to determine how biobanks can most efficiently optimise biospecimen quality, and how communication between biobanks and researchers can be improved.",,,Biobank;Biospecimen quality;Cancer;Quality control;Reporting;Research reproducibility;

Consequently, this necessitates biobanks to collect, store and distribute biospecimens under stringent quality control and assurance measures. However, despite this realisation, there remains a lack of standardisation in quality management among biobanks and consensus as to which quality indicators provide the optimal molecular diagnostic performance tools and information for biospecimens. In an attempt to identify key factors that predict tissue specimen integrity and quality, this systematic review investigated the measures reported in the literature, which characterised the collection, processing and storage of high-quality tissue specimens. Our findings demonstrated RNA integrity, alone, may not be an effective measure of tissue quality. Furthermore, the frequently reported parameters related to biospecimen integrity, such as storage time, temperature, time to cryopreservation and tissue morphology were also not effective indicators of quality control and assurance. These findings suggest that it is unlikely that a single marker will provide the optimal diagnostic and performance information for biospecimens, but rather, a panel of markers assessing the molecular integrity of the lifespan of the biospecimen is required. Further work is needed to identify which factors predict specimen integrity and quality in biobanked tissue specimens.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Cold Temperature;Cryopreservation;Genetic Markers;Guidelines as Topic;Humans;Quality Control;RNA;RNA Stability;Specimen Handling;Time Factors;CANCER RESEARCH;QUALITY ASSURANCE;QUALITY CONTROL;

In this new way of doing research harmonization of governance is essential in practice, with the aim to make the most use of resources at our disposal, and sharing of samples and data among researchers under common policies regulating the distribution and the use. A biobank-specific Ethics Committee could be seen as a new and type of Ethics Committee, that we suggest to be applied to each biobank, with possible different functions. In particular, considering the possible use of electronic health record data linked to biological specimens in biobanking research, this specific Ethics Committee could draft best practice and ethical guidelines for the utilisation of the EHRs as a tool for genetic research, addressing concerns on accessibility, return of results and privacy and help to educate patients and healthcare providers.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Electronic Health Records;Health Personnel;Humans;Informed Consent;

Many biobanks, particularly population-based biobanks, are framed under the rubric of the bio-economy as national political-economic assets that benefit domestic business, while national populations are framed as a natural resource whose genomics, proteomics, and related biological material and national health data can be exploited. We outline how many biobanks epitomize this 'neoliberal' form of science and innovation in which research is driven by market priorities (e.g., profit, shareholder value) underpinned by state or government policies. As both scientific and political-economic infrastructures, biobanks end up entangled in an array of problems associated with market-driven science and innovation. These include: profit trumping other considerations; rentiership trumping entrepreneurship; and applied research trumping basic research. As a result, there has been a push behind new forms of 'post-neoliberal' science and innovation strategies based on principles of openness and collaboration, especially in relation to biobanks. The proliferation of biobanks and the putative transition in both scientific practice and political economy from neoliberalism to post-neoliberalism demands fresh social scientific analyses, particularly as biobanks become further established in fields such as oral health and personalized dentistry.

Biomarkers for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (BIOMARKAPD) is a European multicenter study, funded by the EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, which aims to improve the clinical use of body fluid markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective was to standardize the assessment of existing assays and to validate novel fluid biomarkers for AD and PD. To support the validation of novel biomarkers and assays, a central and a virtual biobank for body fluids and associated data from subjects with neurodegenerative diseases have been established. In the central biobank, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples were collected according to the BIOMARKAPD standardized pre-analytical procedures and stored at Integrated BioBank of Luxembourg. The virtual biobank provides an overview of available CSF, plasma, serum, and DNA samples at each site. Currently, at the central biobank of BIOMARKAPD samples are available from over 400 subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, PD, PD with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.

An analysis of UK Biobank data on musculoskeletal pain.,"Gary J Macfarlane,Marcus Beasley,Blair H Smith,Gareth T Jones,Tatiana V Macfarlane",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26526341/," Biobank-type studies are typically large but have very low participation rates. It has been suggested that these studies may provide biased estimates of prevalence but are likely to provide valid estimates of association. We test these hypotheses using data collected on pain in a large Biobank study in the United Kingdom. UK Biobank recruited 503,325 persons aged 40-69 years (participation rate 5.5%). Participants completed questionnaires, including pain, lifestyle and environment factors. As a comparison, we used both a large population study of pain (MUSICIAN: n = 8847, aged: 40-69 years) conducted 2008-2009 and the National Child Development study (NCDS) which recruited all persons in Great Britain born during one week of 1958 and followed them up at age 44 years (n = 9377). 'Any pain' (UK Biobank 61.0%; MUSICIAN 63.9%), chronic pain (42.9%, 52.2%) and site-specific musculoskeletal pain (back 26.2%, 29.7%; shoulder/neck 23.3%, 25.3%) were generally similar in UK Biobank and MUSICIAN. The prevalence of chronic pain and most regional musculoskeletal pains in UK Biobank were all within 2% of that in NCDS. UK Biobank has provided estimates of the prevalence of pain which are similar to those from previous large-scale studies, although a formal comparison of the estimates cannot be made. It has also confirmed known associations with the reporting of pain. Despite its very low participation rate, such a study provides the opportunity to investigate novel exposure-pain relationships and investigate rarer exposures and characteristics to further our knowledge of the epidemiology of pain.",,,UK Biobank;associations;musculoskeletal;pain;prevalence;

Corresponding cells from mouse replaced human tumour stromal and endothelial cells in second generation PDXs as demonstrated with mouse-specific vimentin and CD31 immunohistochemical staining. For biobanking purposes two cryopreservation methods, a fetal calf serum (FCS)-based (95%v/v)  FCS/DMSO  protocol and a low serum-based (10%v/v)  vitrification  protocol were tested. After primary cryopreservation, tumour take rates were 38% and 67% using either the vitrification or FCS/DMSO-based cryopreservation protocol, respectively. Cryopreserved tumour tissue of established PDXs achieved take rates of 67% and 94%, respectively compared to 91% using fresh PDX tumour tissue. Genotyping analysis showed that no changes in copy number alterations were introduced by any of the biobanking methods. Our results indicate that both protocols can be used for biobanking of ovarian tumour and PDX tissues. However, FCS/DMSO-based cryopreservation is more successful.

In addition, biobanks provide the volume, variety, veracity, and velocity of data that can address the challenges of nursing research. Nurse scientists, research nurse coordinators and clinical research and practice nurses must be informed about the various benefits and risks associated with biobanking in addition to ethical issues surrounding informed consent, participant privacy, and the release of research results.

Therefore, biobanking is very relevant for biomarker discovery and evaluation for these neurological diseases.An important aspect of CSF biobanking is quality control, needed for e.g. consistent patient follow-up and the exchange of patient samples between research centers. Systematic studies to address effects of pre-analytical and storage variation on a broad range of CSF proteins are needed and initiated.Important features of CSF biobanking are intensive collaboration in international networks and the tight application of standardized protocols. The current adoption of standardized protocols for CSF and blood collection and for biobanking of these samples, as presented in this chapter, enables biomarker studies in large cohorts of patients and controls.In conclusion, biomarker research in neurodegenerative diseases has entered a new era due to the collaborative and multicenter efforts of many groups. The streamlining of biobanking procedures, including sample collection, quality control, and the selection of optimal control groups for investigating biomarkers is an important improvement to perform high quality biomarker studies.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Humans;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Quality Control;Biobank;Biomarkers;Cerebrospinal fluid;Neurology;Quality control;

The law covers both clinical and research collections and provides institutions with great flexibility in terms of transferring existing collections into a biobank. The law also includes provisions for individuals whose samples are stored in the biobank to request information regarding the studies in which the sample has been used. However, this provision also compels biobanks to provide an account of the significance of the research findings to their individual health. This legal provision has created tension between policy and practice in that most biobanks will struggle to interpret and apply this provision in practice. The relationship between the rights and needs to conduct research using biobank material and individual rights of access is sometimes unclear and fraught with interpretational challenges. The derivation of national interpretations of European Directives and Conventions gives rise to what I call interpretive regulatory dissonance.

Tumor biobanks are an important source for these biospecimens and support both prospective and retrospective research studies. Supporting retrospective research requires tumor tissue biobanks to accrue an adequate inventory, or stock, of cases comprising tumor biospecimens and associated treatment and outcomes data. We propose a model to establish appropriate targets for stocks of frozen tissue biospecimens in tumor biobanks, sufficient to support cancer research needs. Our model considers national levels of investment in academic cancer research relative to research use of cases described in publication output, and scales this to the local context of the BC Cancer Agency Tumour Tissue Repository (TTR) as an example. Adjustment factors are then applied to correct for the primary intended user base of the biobank, as well as variables intrinsic to all biobanking operations and case collection. On this basis we estimate a current target stock for the TTR of approximately 4500 cases. Local research demand derived from case release data can then be applied to fine-tune accrual targets and refine the biobank's relative portfolio of cases from different tumor sites. We recognize that current targets will need regular remodeling as research demands change over time and that our initial model has some limitations related to the need to extrapolate from available research and biobank utilization data, and does not incorporate biospecimen/case contributions within the context of a network. However, we believe the lack of models to estimate inventory targets for tumor biobanks and to better balance research demand with biospecimen supply, contributes to the hesitation of funders to provide support, and also the problems of sustainability faced by many biobanks. Creating tangible inventory targets will improve biobank efficiency, sustainability, and may also encourage increased and stable funding.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cryopreservation;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Neoplasms;Specimen Handling"

As a result, informatics awareness and capabilities of a biobank are now intrinsically related to quality. A biobank may be considered a data repository, in the form of raw data (the unprocessed samples), data surrounding the samples (processing and storage conditions), supplementary data (such as clinical annotations), and an increasing ethical requirement for biobanks to have a mechanism for researchers to return their data. The informatics capabilities of a biobank are no longer simply knowing sample locations; instead the capabilities will become a distinguishing factor in the ability of a biobank to provide appropriate samples. There is an increasing requirement for biobanking systems (whether in-house or commercially sourced) to ensure the informatics systems stay apace with the changes being experienced by the biobanking community. In turn, there is a requirement for the biobanks to have a clear informatics policy and directive that is embedded into the wider decision making process. As an example, the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank in the UK was a collaboration between four individual and diverse biobanks in the UK, and an informatics platform has been developed to address the challenges of running a distributed network. From developing such a system there are key observations about what can or cannot be achieved by informatics in isolation.

593,Ethical review of biobank research: Should RECs review each release of material from biobanks operating under an already-approved broad consent and data protection model?,"Daniel Strech",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394267/," The use of broad consent in biobank research has implications for the procedures of ethics review. This paper describes these implications and makes a recommendation for how to deal with them. Two steps in the ethics review of biobank research can be distinguished. In a first step, a research ethics committee (REC) reviews a biobank's framework regarding oversight procedures (e.g. broad consent form and data protection model). A second step then reviews specific projects that require the release of particular biomaterial and/or data. This paper argues that only a few research-related risks remain for the second step of ethical review and that a self-regulated body such as a biobank internal access committee would suffice (in principle) to address these risks. The reduction of REC involvement in biobank research proposed here has three aims: (i) to conserve time and money, (ii) to allow RECs to focus on higher-risk areas, and (iii) to promote professional self-regulation. Assuming that the public understands that neither REC involvement nor competent access committees can guarantee 100% protection against misuse of data, the proposed reduction of REC involvement could also enhance the public perception of biobank research as an ethically-sensitive enterprise that can be sufficiently controlled through competent self-regulation. In order to compensate for reduced REC involvement and to maintain public trust, biobanks should implement safeguards such as public information on approved projects.",,,Advisory Committees;Biological Specimen Banks;Computer Security;Informed Consent;Access committee;Approval;Biobank;Biospecimens;Broad consent;Data access;Ethics review;Research ethics committee;

A national computer assisted telephone interview was conducted amongst a representative sample of (n = 800) adult residents across each Australian State and Territory. The majority of the Australian general public would be interested in receiving IRR and IF if they allowed their blood/tissue to be used in research; 94.4% (n = 800) reported that they would like to receive 'specific information obtained from your sample that may be important to your health or treatment', and 83.4% their 'potential genetic risk of an inherited disease'. Although fewer desired to receive 'any IF that were not directly related to your (potential) diagnosed condition' (70.0%), most would still like to receive IF. A latent class analysis on the desire to receive (or not) all types of results revealed differences in preferences in the information they wished to receive. The majority of Australians desire to receive most information arising from research involving their tissue, including IRR and IF. Differences in the extent and type of information they desire to receive are noted.

In parallel to the normative debate, many socio-empirical studies have been conducted to gather experiences, preferences and views of patients, healthy research participants and further stakeholders. However, there is scarcity of literature which connects the normative debate about justifications for different consent models with findings gained in empirical research. In this paper we discuss findings of a limited review of socio-empirical research on patients' and healthy research participants' experiences and views regarding consent to biobank research in light of ethical principles for appropriate information and consent. Review question: Which empirical data are available on research participants' perceptions and views regarding information and elicitation of consent for biobank research? Search of articles published till March 1st 2014 in Pubmed. Review of abstracts and potentially relevant full text articles by two authors independently. As categories for content analysis we defined (i) understanding or recall of information, (ii) preferences regarding information or consent, and (iii) research participants' concerns. The search in Pubmed yielded 337 abstracts of which 10 articles were included in this study. Approaches to information and consent varied considerably across the selected studies. The majority of research participants opted for some version of limited consent when being informed about such possibility. Among the factors influencing the type of preferred consent were information about sponsoring of biobank research by pharmaceutical industry and participants' trade-off between privacy and perceived utility. Studies investigating research participants' understanding and recall regarding the consent procedure indicated considerable lack of both aspects. Research participants' perceptions of benefits and harms differ across those studies. The knowledge, perceptions and views of research participants who have undergone a consent procedure within the context of biobank research raise several questions on the issue of how to inform and elicit consent in an ethically acceptable way. In our empirical-ethical analysis we develop suggestions on how the practice of eliciting consent in the biobank context should be improved.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Comprehension;Ethical Analysis;Ethics, Research;Genomics;Humans;Informed Consent;Mental Recall;Moral Obligations;Privacy;Research Subjects;Social Perception;Therapeutic Misconception"

In many cases, the lack of health professional support can be a limiting factor in the biobanking process of collecting and processing high-quality biospecimens. The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of health professionals towards cancer biobanking. Using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, important aspects of biobanking, including accrual, quality, knowledge, responsiveness, impact, access, trust, governance and accreditation, were investigated. In total, 95 of 124 health and medical practitioners who were approached participated in this study (77% response rate). Health professionals in general supported the aims of biobanking with 56% of participants showing willingness to create a biobank and recruit donors (accrual), 85% understanding the importance in the storage and distribution of biospecimens (quality), 88% having an appreciation for the role of a biobank in furthering cancer research (knowledge), 70% showing awareness of the use of biospecimens in future research initiatives (responsiveness) and 73% demonstrating support for a biobank with proper control, authority and credibility measures in place (governance and accreditation). Overall, provided that proper information about the activities of the biobank and researcher access was transparent, health professionals were very willing to support cancer biobanking.

A prerequisite for this effort is to be able to search and access phenotypic, clinical and other information about samples that are currently stored at biobanks in an integrated manner. However, privacy issues together with heterogeneous information systems and the lack of agreed-upon vocabularies have made specimen searching across multiple biobanks extremely challenging. We describe three case studies where we have linked samples and sample descriptions in order to facilitate global searching of available samples for research. The use cases include the ENGAGE (European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology) consortium comprising at least 39 cohorts, the SUMMIT (surrogate markers for micro- and macro-vascular hard endpoints for innovative diabetes tools) consortium and a pilot for data integration between a Swedish clinical health registry and a biobank. We used the Sample avAILability (SAIL) method for data linking: first, created harmonised variables and then annotated and made searchable information on the number of specimens available in individual biobanks for various phenotypic categories. By operating on this categorised availability data we sidestep many obstacles related to privacy that arise when handling real values and show that harmonised and annotated records about data availability across disparate biomedical archives provide a key methodological advance in pre-analysis exchange of information between biobanks, that is, during the project planning phase.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Factual;Information Storage and Retrieval;Privacy"

600,Governing the research-care divide in clinical biobanking: Dutch perspectives.,"Martin Boeckhout,Conor M W Douglas",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26246123/,"Biobanking, the large-scale, systematic collection of data and tissue for open-ended research purposes, is on the rise, particularly in clinical research. The infrastructures for the systematic procurement, management and eventual use of human tissue and data are positioned between healthcare and research. However, the positioning of biobanking infrastructures and transfer of tissue and data between research and care is not an innocuous go-between. Instead, it involves changes in both domains and raises issues about how distinctions between research and care are drawn and policed. Based on an analysis of the emergence and development of clinical biobanking in the Netherlands, this article explores how processes of bio-objectification associated with biobanking arise, redefining the ways in which distinctions between research and clinical care are governed.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Ethics Committees, Research;Financing, Government;Humans;Informed Consent;Netherlands;Personal Autonomy;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Precision Medicine"
601,Opinions of Young Adults on Re-Consenting for Biobanking.,"Amanda Rush,Robert Battisti,Belinda Barton,Daniel Catchpoole",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26235663/," To evaluate young adult cancer survivor opinions on whether their biobanked tissue and associated de-identified clinical data obtained during their childhood should require re-consent at the age of majority, when parental consent was originally provided. Thirty young adults (18-34 years old), who were former pediatric oncology patients of The Children's Hospital at Westmead with stored research biospecimens, were recruited. They completed a semistructured interview, which included questions on biobanking re-consent, awareness of biobanked tissue, satisfaction about banked tissue, and independence within the family. Analyses included descriptive and inferential statistics. Sixty percent of participants thought that permission for biobanking should be sought again at adulthood, and the remaining 40% did not think that re-consent was necessary. Seventy percent of participants were unaware of their previously banked tissue, which was dependent upon age at diagnosis. When asked whether they granted permission for their tissue to remain in the biobank, all participants agreed. Although results on whether young adults prefer to re-consent or not for previously biobanked tissue and corresponding clinical data are equivocal, survivors appear to be highly favorable about ongoing biobanking of their childhood specimens for future unspecified research.",,,Adolescent;Adult;Attitude;Attitude to Health;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Neoplasms;New South Wales;Parents;Survivors;Young Adult;

This study aimed to understand potentially mutable attitudes and opinions commonly correlated with biobank participation in order to inform approaches to promote participation in biobanks. Adults from two University of Maryland (UMD) Faculty Physicians, Inc. outpatient practices were invited to watch a video and complete a survey about a new biobank initiative. We used: Chi-square to assess the relationship between willingness to join the biobank and participant characteristics, other potentially mutable attitudes and opinions, and trust in the UMD. We also used t-test to assess the relationship with trust in medical research. We also prioritize proposed actions to improve attitudes and opinions about joining biobanks according to perceived responsiveness. 169 participants completed the study, 51% of whom indicated a willingness to join the biobank. Willingness to join the biobank was not associated with age, gender, race, or education but was associated with respondent comfort sharing samples and clinical information, concerns related to confidentiality, potential for misuse of information, trust in UMD, and perceived health benefit. In ranked order, potential actions we surveyed that might alleviate some of these concerns include: increase chances to learn more about the biobank, increase opportunities to be updated, striving to put community concerns first, including involving community members as leaders of biobank research, and involving community members in decision making. This study identified several attitudes and opinions that influence decisions to join a biobank, including many concerns that could potentially be addressed by engaging community members. We also demonstrate our method of prioritizing ways to improve attitudes and opinions about joining a biobank according to perceived responsiveness.",,,biobank;biorepository;data sharing;preferences;public opinion;research participation;survey;trust;

The purpose of the initiative is to provide a forumand knowledge platform for integrating the extensive experiences collected by the EuPA community, and link it to the European and international biobanking communities at large. The specific impact of providing a forum and easy access to this type of information to the EuPA community is the potential of improving the quality of future sample collections and biobanks, the quality of the research produced from these sample collections, as well as the output and productivity from existing biobanks. The underutilization of biobanks has recently been identified as an emerging issue of biobankingworldwide. Measures to improve our ability to locate and access appropriate sample collections for a wide range of research purposes may enhance both the scientific quality and biobank sustainability, thereby contributing to the important task of moving our research beyond basic findings and mere publications, into clinical practice. This manuscript is intended as a Discussion piece, and represents a recollection of the presentation under the “EuPA Initiative” session at HUPO/EuPA 2014 in Madrid.

We argue that although recent biobanking policies encourage various forms of engagement with publics to ensure legitimacy, different biobanks conceptualize their engagement strategies very differently. We suggest that biobanks undertake a broad range of different strategies with regard to engagement. We argue that these different approaches to engagement strategies are contributing to the construction of populations, whereby specific nationalities, communities, societies, patient groups and political systems become imbued or bio-objectified with particular characteristics, such as compliant, distant, positive, commercialized or authoritarian. This bio-objectification process is problematic in relation to policy aspirations ascribed to biobanking engagement since it gives rise to reified notions of different populations.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Community Participation;Denmark;European Union;Genomics;Humans;Informed Consent;Policy Making;Public Opinion;Public Policy;Quality Control;Social Responsibility;

The potential role of biological determinants of diseases needs to be investigated before the onset of the event of interest in order to limit the problems encountered when examining biological determinants in classical case-control studies. Biobank is now a very sophisticated system that consists of a programmed storage of biological material and related data. Our aim in this paper is to document how biobank constitution is useful for studying biological determinants of aging and to give some indications on methodological issues that can be helpful to optimize the constitution and use of biobanks in aging cohorts. Optimization of sampling through two-phase designs (nested case control or case-cohort studies) allows better efficiency. These elements are, for most of them, not specific to aging populations but are useful more generally for the epidemiology of chronic diseases. Our purpose will be illustrated with some examples and results obtained in an ongoing aging cohort, the Three-City Study.",,,"Age Distribution;Aging;Biomedical Research;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Data Mining;Databases, Factual;Dementia;Epidemiologic Methods;Female;France;Humans;Male;Prevalence;Risk Assessment;Tissue Banks;Vascular Diseases;Aging;Biobank;Cohort;Sampling"
607,Biobanking from the patient perspective.,"Derick Mitchell,Jan Geissler,Alison Parry-Jones,Hans Keulen,Doris C Schmitt,Rosaria Vavassori,Balwir Matharoo-Ball",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29062493/," Biobanks are collections of donations of biological material (DNA, cells, tissue etc.) and related data which are very valuable for research into human diseases. A variety of biobanks exist for example within hospitals, research institutes, pharmaceutical companies and patient organisations. The role of patients in biobanking is changing from being seen simply as donors, to actual collaborators in the design, development and the running of biobanks. In this article, we provide a number of examples of patients acting as partners at the heart of biobanking, where their voice and perspective is being seen and used as a valuable resource for the biobank. Our aim is that these examples can be used by those who work with patients in biobank-based research, to design future strategies for patient and public involvement in all biobanks. Biobanks and biobanking research plays an increasingly important role in healthcare research and delivery as health systems become more patient-centred and medicine becomes more personalised. There is also growing acceptance and appreciation of the value that patients, patient advocacy organisations and the public can bring as stakeholders in biobanking and more generally in research. Therefore, the importance of active, early and sustained engagement and involvement of patient and public representatives in biobanks will become increasingly relevant. Organising and facilitating patient and public involvement in biobanking takes considerable time and effort for all stakeholders involved. Therefore, for any biobank operator considering involving patients and the public in their biobanking activities, consideration of best practices, current guidance, ethical issues and evaluation of involvement will be important. In this article, we demonstrate that patients are much more than donors to biobanks-they are collaborators at the heart of biobanking with an important voice to identify perspective, which can be an extremely valuable resource for all biobanks to utilise. The case studies herein provide examples of good practice of patient involvement in biobanking as well as outcomes from these practices, and lessons learned. Our aim is to provide useful insights from these efforts and potential future strategies for the multiple stakeholders that work with patients and the public involved in biobank-based research.",,,Biobank;Involvement;Partnering;Patient;Research;

609,"Open consent, biobanking and data protection law: can open consent be 'informed' under the forthcoming data protection regulation?","Dara Hallinan,Michael Friedewald",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26085311/,"This article focuses on whether a certain form of consent used by biobanks--open consent--is compatible with the Proposed Data Protection Regulation. In an open consent procedure, the biobank requests consent once from the data subject for all future research uses of genetic material and data. However, as biobanks process personal data, they must comply with data protection law. Data protection law is currently undergoing reform. The Proposed Data Protection Regulation is the culmination of this reform and, if voted into law, will constitute a new legal framework for biobanking. The Regulation puts strict conditions on consent--in particular relating to information which must be given to the data subject. It seems clear that open consent cannot meet these requirements. 4 categories of information cannot be provided with adequate specificity: purpose, recipient, possible third country transfers, data collected. However, whilst open consent cannot meet the formal requirements laid out by the Regulation, this is not to say that these requirements are substantially undebateable. Two arguments could be put forward suggesting the applicable consent requirements should be rethought. First, from policy documents regarding the drafting process, it seems that the informational requirements in the Regulation are so strict in order to protect the data subject from risks inherent in the use of the consent mechanism in a certain context--exemplified by the online context. There are substantial differences between this context and the biobanking context. Arguably, a consent transaction in the biobanking does not present the same type of risk to the data subject. If the risks are different, then perhaps there are also grounds for a reconsideration of consent requirements? Second, an argument can be made that the legislator drafted the Regulation based on certain assumptions as to the nature of 'data'. The authors argue that these assumptions are difficult to apply to genetic data and accordingly a different approach to consent might be preferable. Such an approach might be more open consent friendly.",,,Attitude of Health Personnel;Biological Specimen Banks;Computer Security;Confidentiality;Consent Forms;European Union;Genetic Research;Germany;Humans;Informed Consent;Research Subjects;Risk Factors;Social Responsibility;

After identifying candidate biobanking ontologies (Stage 1) and competency questions (Stage 2), a six-step lexical evaluation approach, which assesses the coverage of concepts, properties or instances defined by competency questions is suggested and described (Stage 3). We were able to perform a proof-of-concept evaluation of the OMIABIS ontology using our proposed three-stage approach together with a sample competency question. Our evaluation approach allows a swift evaluation of candidate ontology entities based on a search for higher hierarchy key terms that exist in comprehensive medical vocabularies in order to state the usability of specific ontologies for the biobanking domain.",,,Austria;Biological Ontologies;Biological Specimen Banks;Machine Learning;Meaningful Use;Natural Language Processing;Terminology as Topic;

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information. Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres. UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score to the overall UK population. About 500,000 participants were included in the UK Biobank. We excluded participants with more than 80% variables missing (n=746). Of 498,103 UK Biobank participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37-73 years, 8532 (39% of whom were women) died during a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 4·33-5·22). Self-reported health (C-index including age 0·74 [95% CI 0·73-0·75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0·73 [0·72-0·74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0·80 [0·77-0·83] for men and 0·79 [0·76-0·83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0·0001 in men and p=0·0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire. Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population. The prediction score we have developed accurately predicts 5 year all-cause mortality and can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by health professionals and organisations to identify high-risk individuals and guide public policy.

We used results from a recent comprehensive survey of cancer biobanks in New South Wales, Australia to assess the applicability of this biobank classification schema in an Australian setting. Cancer biobanks were identified using publically available data, and by consulting with research managers. A comprehensive survey was developed and administered through a face-to-face setting. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel™ 2010 and IBM SPSS Statistics™ version 21.0. The cancer biobank cohort (n=23) represented 5 mono-user biobanks, 7 oligo-user biobanks, and 11 poly-user biobanks, and was analyzed as two groups (mono-/oligo- versus poly-user biobanks). Poly-user biobanks employed significantly more full-time equivalent staff, and were significantly more likely to have a website, share staff between biobanks, access governance support, utilize quality control measures, be aware of biobanking best practice documents, and offer staff training. Mono-/oligo-user biobanks were significantly more likely to seek advice from other biobanks.

Therefore, this legislation lays down a series of basic principles, for instance, the principle to inform donors accurately i) on the deposit of samples in terms of the objectives and implications of their donation and on the need to obtain written consents; ii) on the obligation to establish consistent procedures to guarantee the confidentiality of personal data associated with and obtained from biological samples; iii) on the concept of free sample donation either by donors or by biobanks; iv) on the need for consistent procedures to deposit samples and data in biobanks; and v) for acts of donation and data for research projects to be performed correctly.

(2) The immediate purpose of imaging biobanks should be to allow the generation of imaging biomarkers for use in research studies and to support biological validation of existing and novel imaging biomarkers. (3) A long-term scope of imaging biobanks should be the creation of a network/federation of such repositories integrated with the already-existing biobanking network. The aim of the WG was to investigate the existence, consistency, geographical distribution and type of imaging biobanks in Europe. A survey among ESR members resulted in the identification of 27 imaging biobanks, mostly disease-oriented and designed for research and clinical reference.

Most biobanks are located in high-income countries, but the landscape is rapidly changing as low- and middle-income countries develop their own. When establishing a biobank in any setting, researchers have to consider a series of ethical, legal and social issues beyond those in traditional medical research. In addition, many countries may have inadequate legislative structures and governance frameworks to protect research participants and communities from unfair distribution of risks and benefits. International collaborations are frequently being created to support the establishment and proper running of biobanks in low- and middle-income countries. However, these collaborations cause cross-border issues – such as benefit sharing and data access.

A 2 (face-to-face versus multimedia) × 2 (standard versus enhanced interactivity) experimental design was used with 200 patients randomly assigned to receive informed consent. All patients received the same information provided in the biobank's nine-page consent document. Interactivity (F(1,196) = 7.56, P = 0.007, partial η(2) = 0.037) and media (F(1,196) = 4.27, P = 0.04, partial η(2) = 0.021) independently improved participants' understanding of the biobank consent. Interactivity (F(1,196) = 6.793, P = 0.01, partial η(2) = 0.033), but not media (F(1,196) = 0.455, not significant), resulted in increased participant confidence in their understanding of the biobank's consent materials. Patients took more time to complete the multimedia condition (mean = 18.2 min) than the face-to-face condition (mean = 12.6 min). This study demonstrated that interactivity and multimedia each can be effective at promoting an individual's understanding and confidence in their understanding of a biobank consent, albeit with additional time investment. Researchers should not assume that multimedia is inherently interactive, but rather should separate the two constructs when studying electronic consent.",,,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Communication;Comprehension;Consent Forms;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Medical Informatics Applications;Middle Aged;Multimedia;Prospective Studies;Surveys and Questionnaires"

U.S. adults surveyed online in English and Spanish were randomly assigned to one of two scenarios examining acceptance of broad consent (n=1528), or narrow consent (n=1533). Overall, willingness to provide broad (76%) and narrow (74%) consents were similar. African Americans were as likely as white non-Hispanics to accept narrow consent (72% vs. 77%, p=0.35) but significantly less likely to accept broad consent (69% vs. 81%, p=0.004). Education, insurance, and blood donation history were also related to acceptance. Adjusting for beliefs about privacy and policy protections (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, GINA), the effects of the variables were reduced. Respondents who drew comfort from GINA were more likely to support both consent (both p<0.001); those who believed it is impossible to maintain privacy were less likely to find both broad (p=0.04) and narrow models acceptable (p=0.02). Choice of consent model matters when engaging diverse populations in biobank research. Beliefs underlying concerns about privacy and genetic protections should be considered when constructing biobank protocols.",,,"Adult;Black or African American;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Privacy;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;White People;Young Adult"
624,Impacts of a biobank: Bridging the gap in translational cancer medicine.,"Tushar Vora,Nirav Thacker",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25810570/,The prevalence of people affected by cancer has been steadily increasing. More and more people are being offered the chance of increased longevity. This has been possible due to advances not only in medicines and techniques but also because of the gain in understanding of cancer biology through Translational Cancer Medicine. A significant step towards obtaining this success was the establishment of successful biobanking practise. In this review we discuss about the importance of a Biobank and the various impacts that a biobank can have not only in the field of cancer but also on many other aspects. Later we discuss a method of quantitative evaluation of these impacts of a biobank.,,,Biobank;impact;translational cancer medicine;

We explore the effects of data sharing and the type of third-party access (public vs. private) on public trust and, in turn, the intention to participate in biobank research. An experimental design was used to assess a national sample of 1,701 Australians via a computer-assisted telephone interview. The results revealed that trust and the intention to participate significantly decreased in relation to private compared to public biobanks, and when access to third-party researchers was allowed compared to when it was not. Somewhat surprisingly, no differences were found in relation to the third party being international compared to Australian, but trust and the intention to participate were significantly eroded when private third parties were allowed access. Those with a university education were particularly distrustful of private biobanks and biobanks that allowed access, while those who were more aware of genetic databases appeared more confident with biobanks sharing with private-sector third parties. The pattern of results suggests that public awareness of the need for biobanks to share their resources widely needs to be increased to maintain public trust and support.",,,Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Community Participation;Data Collection;Genetic Privacy;Genetic Research;Humans;Information Dissemination;Intention;Male;Professional-Patient Relations;Research Personnel;Socioeconomic Factors;Trust;

However, even for a single hospital or institute, where both population-based and multiple disease-based biobanks have existed for a long time, the integration of existing separate biobanks into a virtual cancer biobank is still challenging. The guidelines and procedures for biobanking are varied and not universally enforced or followed in separate biobanks. Within the last 2 years, we initiated a project to establish a centralized biobank facility in a common storage environment. Analyzing the challenges and interests of stakeholders for the biobanks, a working group comprised of representatives from the central and separate banks, ethic committees, and research administration offices reached an agreement to implement a central facility by following the ISBER best practices for biobanking, and including regular project reviews by the ethical and scientific boards. Furthermore, by implementing a modified minimum information system with biobank data sharing, a network based intra-hospital virtual cancer bank was established to facilitate sharing information of samples held by separate banks. Meanwhile, this virtual biobank network, which has integrated patient information from hospital health care systems, will gradually integrate follow-up information from the cancer registry office and data from epidemiology studies, providing controlled access for sample providers and resource users. In the future, this infrastructure designed for a single hospital may be helpful for building a broader virtual network for data and specimen exchanges.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;China;Databases, Factual;Hospitals;Humans;Information Dissemination;Internet;Neoplasms;Registries"

The program for this 1-day, live workshop included lectures by three biobanking experts, followed by presentations from existing biobanks in Puerto Rico and audience discussion. The need for increasing biobanking expertise in Puerto Rico stems from the fact that Hispanics in general are underrepresented in the biobanks in existence in the US, which limits the research conducted specifically to understand the molecular differences in cancer cells compared to other better studied populations. In turn, this lack of information impairs the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for our population. Dr. James Robb, M.D., F.C.A.P., consulting pathologist to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR), opened the workshop with a discussion on the basic aspects of the science of biobanking (e.g., what is a biobank; its goals and objectives; protocols and procedures) in his talk addressing the importance of banking tissues for advancing biomedical research. Next, Dr. Gustavo Stefanoff, from the Cancer Institutes Network of Latin America (RINC by its name in Spanish), explained the mission, objectives, and structure of the Network of Latin-American and Caribbean Biobanks (REBLAC by its name in Spanish), which despite limited resources and many challenges, currently accrue high quality human tissue specimens and data to support cancer research in the region. Dr. Robert Hunter-Mellado, Professor of Internal Medicine, Universidad Central del Caribe, followed with an examination of the ethical and regulatory aspects of biobanking tissues for future research, including informed consent of subjects; protection of human subjects rights; and balancing risks and benefit ratios. In the afternoon, the directors of existing biobanks in Puerto Rico (the Puerto Rico Biobank, the Comprehensive Cancer Center biobank, and an HIV-focused biobank at Universidad Central del Caribe) presented their experiences and challenges with establishing biobanks for research in Puerto Rico.

Guidelines indicate that children should be involved in the consent procedure. It is, however, unclear how to allocate an appropriate role for children. Knowledge of current practice will be helpful in addressing this issue. Therefore, we conducted an international multiple-case study on the child's role in consent procedures in pediatric biobanks. Four biobanks were included: (1) LifeLines, (2) Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA), (3) Young-HUNT3 and (4) the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank contribution to the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group tissue bank (ORB/CCLG). Four themes linked to the child's role in the consent procedure emerged from the multiple-case study: (1) motives to involve the child, (2) informing the child, (3) the role of dissent, assent and consent and (4) voluntariness of children to participate. We conclude that biobank characteristics influence the biobank's motives to include children in the consent procedure. Moreover, the motives to include children influence how the children are involved in the consent procedure, and the extent to which children are able to make voluntary decisions as part of the consent procedure.

Electronic consent (e-consent) presents one option for streamlining the biobank consent process, and improving contributor understanding of consent information. An e-mail survey was conducted to establish the extent of current biobank e-consent and interest in future use of e-consent. A total of 235 biobanks were surveyed and 65 (28%) responded with a fully completed survey. Few of these 65 biobanks (8%) reported using e-consent; however, the majority (75%) were interested in e-consent. Many (48%) biobanks were in discussions with institutional stakeholders about using e-consent in the future. Anticipated benefits of e-consent included improved efficiency and increased enrollment. Perceived barriers to e-consent adoption included lack of funding, issues with human subjects approval, and factors affecting user uptake (e.g., computer literacy). Biobanks using e-consent reported cost, technology issues, and difficulty training staff as barriers to e-consent adoption. Traditional consenting methods (e.g., face-to-face, phone, and mail) continued to be used at biobanks reporting use of e-consent. The survey results suggest strong interest in e-consent among U.S. biobanks, and a need to consider a range of implementation issues, including user preferences and receptivity; institutional and technical support; integration with clinical data networks; electronic signature capture; and what type of e-consent to implement.

641,Construction of a business model to assure financial sustainability of biobanks.,"Rainer Warth,Aurel Perren",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25496150/,"Biobank-suisse (BBS) is a collaborative network of biobanks in Switzerland. Since 2005, the network has worked with biobank managers towards a Swiss biobanking platform that harmonizes structures and procedures. The work with biobank managers has shown that long-term, sustainable financing is difficult to obtain. In this report, three typical biobank business models are identified and their characteristics analyzed. Five forces analysis was used to understand the competitive environment of biobanks. Data provided by OECD was used for financial estimations. The model was constructed using the business model canvas tool. The business models identified feature financing influenced by the economic situation and the research budgets in a given country. Overall, the competitive environment for biobanks is positive. The bargaining power with the buyer is negative since price setting and demand prediction is difficult. In Switzerland, the healthcare industry collects approximately 5600 U.S. dollars per person and year. If each Swiss citizen paid 0.1% (or 5 U.S. dollars) of this amount to Swiss biobanks, 45 million U.S. dollars could be collected. This compares to the approximately 10 million U.S. dollars made available for cohort studies, longitudinal studies, and pathology biobanks through science funding. With the same approach, Germany, the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom could collect 361, 2634, 154, 264, and 221 million U.S. dollars, respectively. In Switzerland and in other countries, an annual fee less than 5 U.S. dollars per person is sufficient to provide biobanks with sustainable financing. This inspired us to construct a business model that not only includes the academic and industrial research sectors as customer segment, but also includes the population. The revenues would be collected as fees by the healthcare system. In Italy and Germany, a small share of healthcare spending is already used to finance selected clinical trials. The legal frameworks could serve as templates for the business model proposed here.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;France;Germany;Italy;Switzerland;United Kingdom;United States;

Despite the need for retrospective future-proofed cancer repositories, they are presented with significant fiscal challenges. While it was once thought that biobanks could recover most, if not all, operational costs through distribution fees, biobanks have been consistently unable to fully realize this dream. Using data from three mature Canadian cancer biobanks, common attributes and assumptions related to cost recovery were evaluated. The values were entered into a simple financial model to determine the cost recovery potential for biobanks. Over a 5-year period analyzed, aliquots from almost 40% (8990) of 23055 cases collected have been distributed in whole or in part to researchers. The financial modeling demonstrates that, based on values derived from the real life experiences of three major Canadian biobanks, full cost recovery through distribution is not feasible. A more realistic, experience based, expectation of cost recovery from distribution fees is in the range of 5%-25%, and this range is lower if only academic research is supported as opposed to also supporting industry researchers. Biobanks are expensive and, to mitigate costs, are frequently challenged to operate under  self-sustainable  financial models. However, the only possible route to self-sustainability through distribution fees in today's market would require an almost exclusive targeting of commercial researchers and, even then, evidence suggests this is an impossible goal to attain. Support for biobanks should recognize that they exist to further development of personalized treatments and diagnostics essential for precision medicine. For biobanks to continue to achieve this goal, pro bono publicum, funders need to be aware of the full funding requirements of biobanks and create appropriate funding streams.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;

We used descriptive statistics to summarize participant responses, and bivariate statistics to compare willingness to participate in biobanking by disease and demographic factors. A total of 26 interviews were conducted. Various themes emerged from the interviews and aided in the development of the survey instrument. Concerns focused on storage, loss of confidentiality, outside uses, and life insurance discrimination. A total of 1007 individuals completed the survey. Overall, 397 (39.4%) reported that they would definitely donate samples, 568 (56.4%) would probably donate, 36 (3.6%) probably not, and 6 (0.6%) would definitely not donate. No significant differences in willingness to donate samples were seen for Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis (P = 0.25) or for remission versus active disease (P = 0.14). For sample-type preference, 956 (89.6%) would donate blood, 997 (93.5%) saliva, and 822 (77.1%) stool.

645,Public's attitudes on participation in a biobank for research: an Italian survey.,"Corinna Porteri,Patrizio Pasqualetti,Elena Togni,Michael Parker",,,,,2014,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425352/," The creation of biobanks depends upon people's willingness to donate their samples for research purposes and to agree to sample storage. Moreover, biobanks are a public good that requires active participation by all interested stakeholders at every stage of development. Therefore, knowing public's attitudes towards participation in a biobank and biobank management is important and deserves investigation. A survey was conducted among family members of patients attending the outpatient department of our institute for a geriatric or neurological visit, documenting their willingness to participate in a biobank and their views on the legal-ethical aspects of biobank management. Information regarding subjects' attitudes on biomedical research in general and genetic research in particular was also collected. Participants' data on biobanks were compared with data previously collected from the Italian ethics committees (ECs) to evaluate the extent to which lay people and ethics committees share views and concerns regarding biobanks. One hundred forty-five subjects took part in the survey. The willingness to give biological samples for the constitution of a biobank set up for research purposes was declared by 86% of subjects and was modulated by subjects' education. People in favour of providing biological samples for a biobank expressed a more positive view on biomedical research than did people who were not in favour; attitude towards genetic research in dementia was the strongest predictor of participation. Different from ECs that prefer specific consent (52%) and do not choose the option of broad consent (8%) for samples collection in a biobank, participants show a clear preference for broad consent (57%), followed by partially restricted consent (16%), specific consent (15%), and multi-layered consent (12%). Almost all of the subjects available to contribute to a biobank desire to receive both individual research results and research results of general value, while around fifty per cent of ECs require results communication. Family members showed willingness to participate in a biobank for research and expressed a view on the ethical aspects of a biobank management that differ on several issues from the Italian ECs' opinion. Laypersons' views should be taken into account in developing biobank regulations.",,,"Adult;Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic;Duty to Recontact;Family;Female;Genetic Research;Humans;Italy;Male;Mental Disorders;Middle Aged;Motivation;Public Opinion;Specimen Handling;Surveys and Questionnaires"
646,Getting a Fair Share: Attitudes and Perceptions of Biobank Stakeholders Concerning the Fairness of Sample Sharing.,"Flora Colledge,Bernice Elger",,,,,2014,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25425240/,"Biobanks are essential tools for furthering a broad range of medical research areas. However, despite the plethora of national and international laws and guidelines which apply to them, the access and sharing policies of biobanks are only sparsely addressed by regulatory bodies. The 'give and take' process of biosample sharing is largely left up to biobank stakeholders themselves to oversee; it is therefore both in stakeholders' power, and in their interest, to ensure that sample accessibility is fair. This is an important step in motivating researchers to collaborate and pool samples, and is crucial to fostering trust in the absence of universally accepted standard practices. To date, little attention has been paid to how fairness considerations affect scientific material sharing, and no empirical research has been carried out to determine the role that fairness plays in collaborative studies. In order to begin to gain understanding in this area, we interviewed 36 biobank stakeholders currently working in Switzerland, focusing on their perceptions of current and optimal fair sharing practices. Our findings reveal that fairness is an important feature of exchange situations for these stakeholders, and that they have well-formed notions about the practical elements of fair sample access, although ideas about the concept of fairness itself are vague. In order to support efforts to network biobanks, attention should be paid to this issue to reassure all involved that they are getting a fair share in their cooperative efforts.",,,Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cooperative Behavior;Humans;Research Personnel;Social Perception;Switzerland;Trust;biobank;collaboration;fairness;sharing;

Little attention has been paid to the perspectives and practices of those who operate biobanks. We conducted a study of U.S. biobanks consisting of six in-depth case studies and a large online survey (N =456), which was developed from the case study results. The case studies included qualitative interviews with a total of 24 personnel. Both interview and survey questions focused on how biobanks operate, and what policies and practices govern their relationships with specimen contributors and the researchers who use the specimens. Analysis revealed unexpected ethical dilemmas embedded in those policies and practices that highlight a need for practical planning. In this paper, we review three issues seldom explored in the ELSI literature: 1. the discrepancy between biobankers' hope that the bank will exist  permanently  and the fact that funding is limited; 2. the lack of planning for what will happen to the specimens if the bank closes; and 3. the concern that once collected, specimens may be underutilized. These dilemmas are missing from current public representations of biobanks, which instead focus on the intrinsic value in storing specimens as essential to the advancement of translational research. We argue that attention to these issues is important for biobanking, and that greater transparency of these policies and practices will contribute to promoting public trust in biobanks.",,,

However, searching for desired data elements among the thousands of available elements and harmonizing differences in terminology, data collection, and structure, is arduous and time consuming. To speed up biobank data pooling we developed BiobankConnect, a system to semi-automatically match desired data elements to available elements by: (1) annotating the desired elements with ontology terms using BioPortal; (2) automatically expanding the query for these elements with synonyms and subclass information using OntoCAT; (3) automatically searching available elements for these expanded terms using Lucene lexical matching; and (4) shortlisting relevant matches sorted by matching score. We evaluated BiobankConnect using human curated matches from EU-BioSHaRE, searching for 32 desired data elements in 7461 available elements from six biobanks. We found 0.75 precision at rank 1 and 0.74 recall at rank 10 compared to a manually curated set of relevant matches. In addition, best matches chosen by BioSHaRE experts ranked first in 63.0% and in the top 10 in 98.4% of cases, indicating that our system has the potential to significantly reduce manual matching work. BiobankConnect provides an easy user interface to significantly speed up the biobank harmonization process. It may also prove useful for other forms of biomedical data integration.

The objectives of this study were to present (1) a synthesis of all consent issues mentioned or required in guidelines that are of potential relevance to biobank research and (2) a detailed overview of similarities and differences between these guidelines. This analysis considered a purposive sample of the nine most internationally recognised research guidelines plus a national checklist for developing consent forms. The synthesis of all included research guidelines found 41 issues of potential relevance to consent procedures in biobank research. The guidelines differ substantially with respect to (1) how comprehensively they address these consent issues, (2) their definition and explanation of the issues and (3) how directly or indirectly the issues are mentioned. The set of 41 consent issues presented in this paper should be further developed in a continuous process.

Their potential power to identify the underlying mechanisms of both rare and common disease has catalyzed their proliferation in the academic, medical, and private sectors. Despite demonstrated public support of biobanks, some within the academic, governmental, and public realms have also expressed cautions associated with the ethical, legal, and social (ELSI) implications of biobanks. These issues include concerns related to the privacy and confidentiality of data; return of results and incidental findings to participants; data sharing and secondary use of samples; informed consent mechanisms; ownership of specimens; and benefit sharing (i.e., the distribution of financial or other assets that result from the research). Such apprehensions become amplified as more researchers seek to pursue national and cross-border collaborations between biobanks. This paper provides an overview of two of the most contentious topics in biobank literature - informed consent and return of individual research results or incidental findings - and explores how a public health ethics lens may help to shed new light on how these issues may be best approached and managed. Doing so also demonstrates the important role that genetic counselors can play in the ongoing discussion of ethically appropriate biobank recruitment and management strategies, as well as identifies important areas of ongoing empirical research on these unresolved topics.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Confidentiality;Genetic Counseling;Humans;Informed Consent;Public Health;

However, uncertainty remains about which of this information participants must understand to provide valid consent. We conducted a Delphi process to define  adequate comprehension  in the context of biobanking consent. The process involved an iterative series of three online surveys of a diverse panel of 51 experts, including genome scientists, biobank managers, ethics and policy experts, and community and participant representatives. We sought consensus (>70% agreement) concerning what specific details participants should know about 16 biobank consent topics. Consensus was achieved for 15 of the 16 consent topics. The exception was the comprehension needed regarding the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Our Delphi process was successful in identifying a concise set of key points that prospective participants must grasp to provide valid consent for biobanking.

Biobanks are an important research resource that provides researchers with biological samples, tools and data, but have also been associated with a range of ethical, legal and policy issues and concerns. Although there have been studies examining the views of different stakeholders, such as donors, researchers and the general public, the media portrayal of biobanks has been absent from this body of research. This study therefore examines how biobanking has been represented in major print newspapers from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to identify the issues and concerns surrounding biobanks that have featured most prominently in the print media discourse. Methods. Using Factiva, articles published in major broadsheet newspapers in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia were identified using specified search terms. The final sample size consisted of 163 articles. Results. Majority of articles mentioned or discussed the benefits of biobanking, with medical research being the most prevalent benefit mentioned. Fewer articles discussed risks associated with biobanking. Researchers were the group of people most quoted in the articles, followed by biobank employees. Biobanking was portrayed as mostly neutral or positive, with few articles portraying biobanking in a negative manner. Conclusion. Reporting on biobanks in the print media heavily favours discussions of related benefits over risks. Members of the scientific research community appear to be a primary source of this positive tone. Under-reporting of risks and a downtrend in reporting on legal and regulatory issues suggests that the print media views such matters as less newsworthy than perceived benefits of biobanking.",,,Biobanks;Consent;ELSI;Evidence-based policy;Media representations;Privacy;Public perceptions;

The heterogeneity of the collected metadata grows as research is evolving in to international multi-disciplinary collaborations and increasing data sharing among institutions. Single standardization is not feasible and it becomes crucial to develop digital repositories with flexible and extensible data models, as in the case of modern integrated biobanks management. We developed a novel data model in JSON format to describe heterogeneous data in a generic biomedical science scenario. The model is built on two hierarchical entities: processes and events, roughly corresponding to research studies and analysis steps within a single study. A number of sequential events can be grouped in a process building up a hierarchical structure to track patient and sample history. Each event can produce new data. Data is described by a set of user-defined metadata, and may have one or more associated files. We integrated the model in a web based digital repository with a data grid storage to manage large data sets located in geographically distinct areas. We built a graphical interface that allows authorized users to define new data types dynamically, according to their requirements. Operators compose queries on metadata fields using a flexible search interface and run them on the database and on the grid. We applied the digital repository to the integrated management of samples, patients and medical history in the BIT-Gaslini biobank. The platform currently manages 1800 samples of over 900 patients. Microarray data from 150 analyses are stored on the grid storage and replicated on two physical resources for preservation. The system is equipped with data integration capabilities with other biobanks for worldwide information sharing. Our data model enables users to continuously define flexible, ad hoc, and loosely structured metadata, for information sharing in specific research projects and purposes. This approach can improve sensitively interdisciplinary research collaboration and allows to track patients' clinical records, sample management information, and genomic data. The web interface allows the operators to easily manage, query, and annotate the files, without dealing with the technicalities of the data grid.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Computational Biology;Data Mining;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Genomics;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;Models, Theoretical;Software;User-Computer Interface"

Capturing the opinions of scientists is important because they are intimately involved with biobanks as collectors and users of samples and health information. In this study, we performed interviews with scientists followed by qualitative analysis to capture the diversity of perspectives on informed consent. We found that the majority of scientists in our study reported their preference for a general consent approach although they do not believe there to be a consensus on consent type. Despite their overall desire for a general consent model, many reported several concerns including donors needing some form of assurance that nothing unethical will be done with their samples and information. Finally, scientists reported mixed opinions about incorporating exclusion clauses in informed consent as a means of limiting some types of contentious research as a mechanism to assure donors that their samples and information are being handled appropriately. This study is one of the first to capture the views of scientists on informed consent in biobanking.

In the second period, between 7-01-13 and 18-02-13 (6 weeks), we carried out general corrective actions. The identification of problems and implementation of corrective actions for certification allowed: a 70% reduction in the process execution time, a significant increase (200%) in the number of samples processed and a 25% improvement in the process. The increase in the number of samples processed was directly related to process improvement. The certification of ISO standard 9001:2008, obtained in July 2013, allowed an improvement of the REDinREN biobank processes to be achieved, which increased quality and customer satisfaction.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Certification;Humans;Nephrology;Spain;Specimen Handling;Time Factors;

This project differs from previous biobanking projects in that it 1) was initiated mainly to boost post-disaster recovery and reconstruction; and 2) targets the area's survivors as its primary subjects. Here, we review the ethics of the ToMMo biobanking project within the wider context of disaster remediation. Private citizens in the Tohoku region have criticized the project proposal, asking for further review of the ethics of targeting disaster survivors for this study. They claim the project violates the Declaration of Helsinki's ethical provisions in that (1) government and university researchers initiated it without consulting any Tohoku survivors; (2) survivors already suffering extreme losses may view study involvement as meaningless or even undesirable, yet feel forced to participate in exchange for tenuous promises of future assistance, thus exploiting those most in need.Although the ToMMo has promised certain future social benefits for the target population in exchange for participating in its biobanking research, it is questionable whether such research can address the immediate health needs of the Tohoku disaster survivors in any significant fashion. The ethics of recruiting still-struggling survivors is also questionable. This case analysis demonstrates that conducting a post-disaster biobanking project on survivors poses issues concerning potential exploitation and the just distribution of benefits and burdens. Though the ToMMo emphasizes the project's importance for individual survivors and regional recovery, it is questionable whether such research can justly respond to the survivors' immediate health needs and whether truly voluntary participation can be ensured in such a crisis. Our society must enhance this nationwide debate and reexamine our priorities for recovery in the disaster-stricken regions. We should evaluate both whether and how this project can truly contribute to the survivors' quality of life.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Coercion;Community Participation;Disaster Medicine;Disaster Victims;Disasters;Earthquakes;Ethics, Research;Fukushima Nuclear Accident;Health Services Needs and Demand;Humans;Japan;Patient Selection;Quality of Life;Survivors"

Through modernization, traditional foods were abandoned, native food starters were substituted with industrial products, vaccines and antibiotics were used, extreme hygiene measures were taken, the rate of cesarean section increased, and breast feeding changed into formula. These factors have reduced human exposure to microbial symbionts and led to shrinkage of the core microbiome.

Twenty-three percent of respondents reported that it was not at all likely that they would donate to a biobank, 18% reported it was a little likely, 36% reported it was somewhat likely, and 23% reported it was very likely. Respondents who were likely to donate to a biobank had greater positive expectations about participating in cancer genetics research and reported more participation facilitators relative to barriers. Respondents who were distrustful of researchers had a significantly lower likelihood of being willing to donate to a biobank compared to those who were less distrustful. African Americans have diverse attitudes about participating in genetics research, and many are likely to donate to a biobank based on expectations of positive outcomes. It may be important to address attitudes about genetics research as part of recruitment to enhance the quality of informed consent for participation in biobanks among African Americans.",,,"Adult;Black or African American;Age Factors;Biological Specimen Banks;Data Collection;Female;Genetic Research;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Informed Consent;Intention;Male;Minority Groups;Motivation;Neoplasms;Tissue Donors;Trust"

The Michigan BioTrust for Health makes dried bloodspots (DBS) leftover from newborn screening, including ~4.5 million collected before 2010 without written consent, available for health research. Absent prospectively gathered consent and/or current engagement with 18- to 29-year olds, little is known about opinions and beliefs from this age group about use of the bloodspots for research. We engaged 2,101 students-BioTrust participants and their peers-at information booths at 20 college campuses across the state to educate youth about the BioTrust and gather information about consent preferences and about hopes and concerns about this public health program. We surveyed student stakeholder DBS research consent preferences and fielded a  postengagement  survey to gauge the attitudes of participants and to evaluate the campus engagement. The most prevalent themes in open-ended comments were support for biobank research and concern that Michiganders are not aware of their participation. While 78 % of students said they would, if asked, opt in to the BioTrust, half of these preferred to be contacted each time a researcher sought to use their DBS. Students reported great interest in the topic and strong likelihood to share what they had learned. BioTrust participants are interested in learning about their role in an initiative whose goals they widely support. Public engagement is particularly important to biobank participants who, absent traditional consent practices, are unaware of their participation. Health-fair style engagements were effective for targeting college-aged stakeholders, communicating complex messages, and likely increasing knowledge. Retrospective biobanks and biobanks that collect proxy consent need policies to respect those who would opt out and will need resources to educate participants and conduct community outreach that is a safeguard to public trust.",,,

This article examines the role of biobanks in basic research of infectious disease genomics, as well as the relevance and applicability of biobanks in the translation of impending knowledge and the clinical uptake of knowledge of infectious diseases. Our research identifies potential fields of interaction between infectious disease genomics and biobanks, in line with global trends in the integration of genome-based knowledge into clinical practice. It also examines various networks and biobanks that specialize in infectious diseases (including HIV, HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis), and provides examples of successful research and clinical uptake stemming from these biobanks. Finally, it outlines key issues with respect to data privacy in infectious disease genomics, as well as the utility of adequately designed and maintained electronic health records. We maintain that the public should be able to easily access a clear and detailed outline of regulations and procedures for sample and data utilization by academic or commercial investigators, and also should be able to understand the precise roles of relevant governing bodies. This would ultimately facilitate uptake by researchers and clinics. As a result of the efforts and resources invested by several networks and consortia, there is an increasing awareness of the prospective uses of biobanks in advancing infectious disease genomic research, diagnostics and their clinical management.",,,Biobank;Chlamydia trachomatis;HIV;HPV;Host genomics;Infectious disease;

This is the consequence of an increase in the need for human biological resources for scientific projects and more specifically, for translational and clinical research. The robustness and reproducibility of the results obtained depend greatly on the quality of the biospecimens and the associated clinical data. They also depend on the number of patients studied and on the expertise of the biobank that supplied the biospecimens. The quality of a research biobank is undoubtedly reflected in the number and overall quality of the research projects conducted with biospecimens provided by the biobank. Since the quality of a research project can be measured from the impact factor of resulting publications, this also provides some indication of the quality of a research biobank. It is necessary for the biobank community to define  surrogate  quality indicators, and to establish systems of evaluation in relation to current and future resource requirements. These indicators will help in the realistic assessment of biobanks by institutions and funding bodies, and they will help biobanks demonstrate their value, raise their quality standards, and compete for funding. Given that biobanks are expensive structures to maintain, funding issues are particularly important, especially in the current economic climate. Use of performance indicators may also contribute to the development of a biobank impact factor or  bioresource research impact factor  (BRIF). Here we review four major categories of indicators that appear to be useful for the evaluation of a(m) HITB (quality, activity, scientific productivity, and  visibility ).

American rural whites are seldom represented in such initiatives as geographic isolation makes obtaining informed consent challenging. We report a case series of 83 newly diagnosed cancer patients, attending a rural community medical center, who consented to participate in cancer research. To enable pooling with population studies, we created a BioGeoBank using 2007 NCI and ISBER Best Practices, after a protocol approval by Eastern Maine Medical Center (EMMC) IRB and OHP HRPO. Informed consent forms were at Flesch-Kincaid 8th Grade reading level, supplemented by NCI educational brochures. Of 108 patients identified, 85 were eligible. Of these, 83 patients (49 lung cancer, 21 breast cancer, and 13 other cancers) consented to donate data, blood, and tissue specimens for future research, and maintained eligibility. Two years later, we executed a legacy protocol to transfer specimens to NCI's biorepository. Of the 69 surviving patients, 9 patients could not be contacted. All those contacted (60) agreed to provide additional data on environmental risks, and consented to specimen transfer. Self-organizing map analyses showed no evidence that age, education, income, familial susceptibility, or lifestyle factors were associated with consent to donate data or biospecimens. Cancer cases reported 1-3 co-morbid chronic diseases (mostly cardiovascular), near lifetime smoking and/or alcohol consumption; familial cancer risks, and many had a prior cancer history. Anecdotally, willingness to consent was based on altruistic hopes that research would generate knowledge to reduce cancer incidence.

Sample quality is an important consideration, as it directly impacts the quality of ensuing research. The aim of the present study was to determine the quality of tissues collected from different sites contributing to the COEUR cohort. Samples from high-grade serous ovarian tumors (fresh frozen and corresponding paraffin-embedded tissues) were provided by nine participating Canadian biobanks. All samples were shipped to a central site using a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP). DNA and RNA extraction was conducted by the quality control division of the Canadian Tumor Repository Network (CTRNet). DNA quality was determined by ß-globin gene PCR amplification, and RNA quality by the RNA integrity number (RIN), as measured by the Agilent BioAnalyzer. DNA of acceptable quality had at least three bands of ß-globin amplified from DNA (n=115/135), and a RIN number ≥7 was considered very good for RNA (n=80/135). Sample preparation and storage time had little effect on RNA or DNA quality. Protein expression was assessed on tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against p53, WT1, E-cadherin, CK-7, and Ki67 from formalin fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. As seen with a nonhierarchical clustering statistical method, there was no significant difference in immunostaining of paraffin tissues among specimens from different biobanks. Interestingly, patients with worse outcome were highly positive for p53 and weak for WT1. In conclusion, while there was no common SOP for retrospectively collected material across Canadian biobanks, these results indicate that specimens collected at these multiple sites are of comparable quality, and can serve as an adequate resource to create a national cohort for the validation of molecular biomarkers in ovarian cancer.",,,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;DNA, Neoplasm;Female;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Middle Aged;Ovarian Neoplasms;Paraffin Embedding;RNA, Neoplasm;Specimen Handling;Staining and Labeling;Tissue Array Analysis"

Increased SA research on these diseases and syndromes and the collection of associated biospecimens has ensured a plethora of biobanks created by individuals, albeit without the foresight of prospective and collective use by other local and international researchers. As the need for access to high-quality specimens in statistically relevant numbers has increased, so has the necessity for the development of national human biobanks in SA and across the Continent. The prospects of achieving sustainable centralized biobanks are still an emerging and evolving concept, primarily and recently driven by the launch of the H3Africa consortium, which includes the development of harmonized and standardized biobanking operating procedures. This process is hindered by a myriad of complex societal considerations and ethico-legal challenges. Efforts to consolidate and standardize biological sample collections are further compromised by the lack of full appreciation by national stakeholders of the biological value inherent in these collections, and the availability of high quality human samples with well-annotated data for future scientific research and development. Inadequate or nonexistent legislative structures that specifically regulate the storage, use, dispersal, and disposal of human biological samples are common phenomena and pose further challenges. Furthermore, concerns relating to consent for unspecified future uses, as well as access to information and data protection, are all new paradigms that require further consideration and public engagement.

However, there are no proposals for specific cost accounting models for these types of organizations in the international scientific literature. The aim of this paper is to present the basis of a cost analysis model useful for any biobank regardless of the human biological samples that it stores for biomedical research. The development of a unique cost model for biobanks can be a complicated task due to the diversity of the biological samples they store. Different types of samples (DNA, tumor tissues, blood, serum, etc.) require different production processes. Nonetheless, the common basic steps of the production process can be identified. Thus, the costs incurred in each step can be analyzed in detail to provide cost information. Six stages and four cost objects were obtained by taking the production processes of biobanks belonging to the Spanish National Biobank Network as a starting point. Templates and examples are provided to help managers to identify and classify the costs involved in their own biobanks to implement the model. The application of this methodology will provide accurate information on cost objects, along with useful information to give an economic value to the stored samples, to analyze the efficiency of the production process and to evaluate the viability of some sample collections.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Budgets;Costs and Cost Analysis;Humans;Models, Economic"

A single biobank cannot provide sufficient numbers of samples to capture the full spectrum of any disease. Currently there is no infrastructure in the United Kingdom (UK) to integrate biobanks. Therefore the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Confederation of Cancer Biobanks (CCB) Working Group 3 looked to establish a data standard to enable biobanks to communicate about the samples they hold and so facilitate the formation of an integrated national network of biobanks. The Working Group examined the existing data standards available to biobanks, such as the MIABIS standard, and compared these to the aims of the working group. The CCB-developed data standard has brought many improvements: (1) Where existing data standards have been developed, these have been incorporated, ensuring compatibility with other initiatives; (2) the standard was written with the expectation that it will be extended for specific disease areas, such as the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank (BCCTB) and the Strategic Tissue Repository Alliances Through Unified Methods (STRATUM) project; and (3) biobanks will be able to communicate about specific samples, as well as aggregated statistics. The development of this data standard will allow all biobanks to integrate and share information about the samples they hold, facilitating the possibility of a national portal for researchers to find suitable samples for research.

However, blood samples containing the anti-coagulant heparin could complicate transcriptomic analysis because heparin may inhibit RNA polymerase causing inefficient cRNA synthesis and fluorophore labelling. We investigated the inhibitory effect of heparin and the influence of storage conditions (0 or 3 hr bench times, storage at room temperature or -80°C) on fluorophore labelling in heparinized fresh human buffy coat and whole blood biobank samples during the mRNA work-up protocol for microarray analysis. Subsequently, we removed heparin by lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment and performed a quality control analysis of LiCl-treated biobank sample microarrays to prove their suitability for downstream data analysis. Both fresh and biobank samples experienced varying degrees of heparin-induced inhibition of fluorophore labelling, making most samples unusable for microarray analysis. RNA derived from EDTA and citrate blood was not inhibited. No effect of bench time was observed but room temperature storage gave slightly better results. Strong correlations were observed between original blood sample RNA yield and the amount of synthesized cRNA. LiCl treatment restored sample quality to normal standards in both fresh and biobank samples and the previously identified correlations disappeared. Microarrays hybridized with LiCl-treated biobank samples were of excellent quality with no identifiable influence of heparin.

The result was evaluated from four aspects: scope of definitions, potential regional differences, differences in semantics and definitions in the context of ontologies, guided by comments from responders. Indicative from the survey is the risk of focusing only on the research aspect of biobanking in definitions. Hence, it is recommended that important terms should be formulated in such a way that all areas of biobanking are covered to improve the bridges between research and clinical application.

Research  (Governance, Re-consent, Education, Accountability, Transparency, Research priorities). These recommendations are being shared with biobanking facilities in Hawai'i as they develop protocols for biobanking participation, governance, and education.

However, relatively little is known about the pace and characteristics of these changes either overall or by region and socioeconomic status. We examined the cross-sectional data from the China Kadoorie Biobank cohort study that recruited 300 000 women born between 1930 and 1974 (mean age: 51 years) from 10 socially diverse urban and rural regions of China. Temporal trends in several self-reported reproductive characteristics, and effect modification of these trends by area and education (as a surrogate for socioeconomic status), were examined. The overall mean age at menarche was 15.4 (standard deviation 1.9) years, but decreased steadily over the 45 birth cohorts from 16.1 to 14.3 years, except for an anomalous increase of ∼1 year for women exposed to the 1958-61 famine in early adolescence. Similarly large changes were seen for other characteristics: mean parity fell (urban: 4.9 to 1.1; rural: 5.9 to 1.4); mean age at first birth increased (urban: 19.0 to 25.9 years; rural: 18.3 to 23.8 years); and birth spacing increased after 1980 to over 5 years. Breastfeeding declined after 1950 in urban and, after 1980, in rural women; and 68% of urban and 48% of rural women experienced a terminated pregnancy. Mean age at menopause increased from 47.9 to 49.3 years. There have been striking changes in reproductive factors over time and between areas among these Chinese women.

All funding providers assume that after initial investments biobanks should be able to operate sustainably. However the topic of sustainability is challenging for the discipline of biobanking for several major reasons: the diversity in the biobanking landscape, the different purposes of biobanks, the fact that biobanks are dissimilar to other research infrastructures and the absence of universally understood or applicable value metrics for funders and other stakeholders. In this article our aim is to delineate a framework to allow more effective discussion and action around approaches for improving biobank sustainability. The term sustainability is often used to mean fiscally self-sustaining, but this restricted definition is not sufficient for biobanking. Instead we propose that biobank sustainability should be considered within a framework of three dimensions - financial, operational, and social. In each dimension, areas of focus or elements are identified that may allow different types of biobanks to distinguish and evaluate the relevance, likelihood, and impact of each element, as well as the risks to the biobank of failure to address them. Examples of practical solutions, tools and strategies to address biobank sustainability are also discussed.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;

Hispanics are less likely to provide biologic specimens for biobanking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of acculturation, nativity status, and years living in the United States with participation in biobanking among individuals of Mexican descent. Participants were 19,212 adults of Mexican descent enrolled in an ongoing population-based cohort in Houston, TX. Participants were offered the opportunity to provide a blood, urine, or saliva sample for biobanking. Acculturation was assessed with the bidimensional acculturation scale for Hispanics and scores were categorized into  low acculturation,   bicultural,  and  high-acculturation.  After multivariable adjustment, we found an increased likelihood of participation in biobanking among individuals classified as  bicultural  as compared with  highly acculturated  individuals [OR, 1.58; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.10-2.26]. The associations of nativity status and years living in the United States with biobanking were not statistically significant. After stratifying by gender, the associations of acculturation, nativity status, and years living in the United States with biobanking were not statistically significant. Although individuals of Mexican descent who were  bicultural  were more likely to participate in biobanking than individuals who were  highly acculturated,  the difference in rates of participation among acculturation categories was small. The high participation rate in biospecimen collection is likely due to extensive community-engaged research efforts. Future studies are warranted to understand individuals' participation in biobanking. Community-engaged research efforts may increase Hispanics' participation in biobanking.

This study describes the development and psychometric properties of the English-language BANKS (Biobanking Attitudes and Knowledge Survey). The BANKS was created by item generation through review of scientific literature, focus groups with community members, and input from a community advisory board. Items were refined through cognitive interviews. Content validity was assessed through an expert panel review. Psychometric properties of the BANKS were assessed in a sample of 85 community members. The final BANKS includes three scales: attitudes, knowledge, and self-efficacy; as well as three single items, which evaluated receptivity and intention to donate a biospecimen for research. Cronbach α coefficients for two scales that use Likert response format indicated high internal consistency (attitudes: α, 0.88; self-efficacy: α, 0.95). Content validity indices were moderate, ranging from 0.69 to 0.89. Intention to donate blood and intention to donate urine were positively correlated with attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and receptivity to learning more about biobanking (P values range from 0.029 to <0.001). The final BANKS shows evidence of satisfactory reliability and validity, is easy to administer, and is a promising tool to inform biospecimen research. Additional studies should be conducted with larger samples considering biospecimen donation to further assess the reliability and validity of the instrument. A valid and reliable instrument measuring community members' views about biobanking may help researchers evaluate relevant communication interventions to enhance understanding, intention, and actual biospecimen donation.

We describe the processes and the tools used in the iterative design of an appropriate informed consent model and the ethico-legal framework of the Piccolipiù study. The Piccolipiù study is a prospective population-based study funded by the Italian Ministry of Health that intends to enrol 3,000 newborns and their mothers in five Italian cities, and to store biological samples for future use. To realise these objectives, we performed a thorough evaluation of the literature, of national and international guidelines, and of the impact of the Italian legal requirements for research biobanking. Discussions among stakeholders facilitated the design of the informed consent and the ethico-legal framework. Several topics are addressed, including the suitability of a broad informed consent for paediatric biobanks, infant vulnerability, access to and sharing of data, and the disclosure of individual's genetic results. Discussion of the ethical and legal procedures adopted in epidemiological biobanking might be a fruitful ground for comparison both at the national level, where standardization and homogeneity are lacking, and at the international level, where different regulatory issues are often in the background and might hamper research biobanks networking.",,,"Cohort Studies;Confidentiality;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Privacy;Genetic Research;Genotype;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Information Dissemination;Informed Consent;Internationality;Italy;Parents;Phenotype"

However, biobanks also raise important ethical considerations, such as whether, how and why biobanks might engage with those who contributed specimens. This paper examines perceptions and practices of community engagement (CE) among individuals who operate 6 diverse biobanks in the US. Twenty-four people from a diverse group of 6 biobanks were interviewed in-person or via telephone from March to July 2011. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed for common themes. Emergent themes include how biobank personnel understand 'community' and CE as it pertains to biobank operations, information regarding the diversity of practices of CE, and the reasons why biobanks conduct CE.

However, sharing is based on the assumption that the donor has given consent to a given use of her or his sample. Biobanking stakeholders, therefore, must choose 1 of 3 options: obtain general consent enabling multiple future uses before taking a sample from the donor, try to obtain consent again before sharing a previously obtained sample, or look for a legally endorsed way to share a sample without the donor's consent. In this study, we present the results of 36 semistructured qualitative interviews with Swiss biobanking stakeholders regarding these options and the role of ethics committees in the process of authorizing sharing. Our results show that despite a lack of legal or guideline-based barriers to general consent, some stakeholders and ethics committees have reservations about this method of consent. In most cases, however, a general consent form is already in use. Many interviewees describe processes involving the ethics committees as time-consuming and cumbersome and their requirements as too demanding for donors/patients. Greater awareness of donors' opinions and preferences and the content of guidelines and recommendations could therefore be helpful for a better justified perspective of biobanking stakeholders and ethical committee members, equally. Finally, it may be necessary to differentiate between procedures governing future samples, where general consent is clearly desirable, and the use of old yet still relevant samples, where the option of using them without consent can be highly beneficial for research.",,,Bioethical Issues;Biological Specimen Banks;Ethics Committees;Humans;Information Dissemination;Informed Consent;Biobank;Data sharing;Ethics committee;Informed consent;Sample sharing;

To achieve long term financial sustainability of biobank infrastructures we propose that a new focus is needed on activities, products and services provided by the biobank that relate to the external stakeholder: biobanking 3.0. Earlier stages of biobanking are biobanking 1.0 (primary focus on the number of biospecimens and data) and biobanking 2.0 (primary focus on the quality of biospecimens and data). Both stages 1.0 and 2.0 are predominantly product oriented areas and have required a mostly internal focus on operational development within the biobank itself. In this paper we will introduce our concept of biobanking 3.0 which capitalizes on the earlier stages but dictates a shift in focus to enhancing the value and impact for the three major sets of external stakeholders (people/patients, funders, and research customers) and creating a path to balanced and planned investment in biobank infrastructure and the sustainability of biobanking. Biobanking 3.0 will improve real understanding as well as perceptions of value across different stakeholders. Patients and donors will appreciate seeing how their biospecimens and data are effectively used for research. Funders will value the ability to plan efficient targeting of funding and to monitor the impact of their support. Researchers will capitalize on the ability to translate their ideas into effective knowledge.

Significant variation persists among the legal and ethical norms governing population biobanks in different jurisdictions. Many of these norms do not clearly provide for international access. To illustrate these problems, we collected and compared applicable legislative instruments, as well as ethical guidelines issued by national, regional, and international bodies. In addition, harmonization is faced with important limitations and may not be sufficient to ensure effective international sharing.

A review of the current literature and interviews with involved parties. Questionnaires were e-mailed to assess current attitudes towards biobanking and opinions of trends and implications for the future. The organisations included commercial biobanks, charitable foundations, academic biobanks, and hospital sites. Biobanks have the potential to have a critical impact across several industrial sectors, and their future success will depend on satisfying the differing needs of each group. There is a growing need for greater collaboration between researchers and biobanks, and if the involvement of industry is not sought by biobanks to create conditions that support the effective use of resources, there is a risk that samples will not be collected or used to the best advantage. It is evident that industry can play a vital role in the innovation process of biobanking, both in terms of the collecting and processing methods and the nature of the disease and sample types collected. With this feedback, biobanks can be utilised effectively to advance research to the benefits of all to the best advantage.",,,"Animals;Biological Specimen Banks;Data Collection;Databases, Factual;Databases, Genetic;Genetic Research;Humans;Specimen Handling"
711,The uniqueness of biobanks for neurological and psychiatric diseases: potentials and pitfalls.,"Rivka Ravid",,,,,2015,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25792212/," Central nervous system (CNS) biobanks are facing difficult and specific challenges due to the sensitive issue of collecting specimens of the CNS, and especially the brain. At present, there is no global network/central database to serve researchers, clinicians and pharma companies, or to supply the special specimens and the accompanying data in sufficient numbers and detail, respectively. The main challenge/objective is to standardize and harmonize all the facets involved in CNS biobanking in order to maximize efficient sample collection. Since the number of CNS biospecimens stored in existing biobanks is relatively limited and the accompanying data are not always readily available and hard to identify, we propose using optimal procedures for handling and storage of these specimens, and the global standardization of the cliniconeuropathological diagnostic criteria. One of the prominent achievements of the current global activity in brain tissue biobanks (BTB-banks) is the development of an inventory of international standards, available specimens and concomitant data, and national registries. Taking into consideration the huge variety of the specimens stored in different repositories and the enormous differences in medicolegal systems and ethics regulations in different countries, we strongly recommend that healthcare systems and institutions who host BTB-banks make efforts to secure adequate funding for the infrastructure and daily activities. BTB-banks will refine standard operating procedures and their internal guides of best practices/codes of conduct. This in turn will enable the BTB-banks to share the collected specimens and data with the largest possible number of researchers, aiming at maximal scientific spin-off and advance of public health research.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Central Nervous System Diseases;Data Collection;Databases, Factual;Humans;Specimen Handling"

RD biobanks play a pivotal role in making such materials and data available to the scientific community. In order to increase the effectiveness of RD biobanks, three major challenges need to be met: maximise access to rare biological samples stored in RD biobanks spread globally by the international scientific community, promote networking among such biobanks to share quality standards and procedures and allow collaboration with RD registries and databases, and finally adopt an efficient management model compliant with legal and ethical issues and ensuring biobank sustainability. The European program RD-Connect, funded under the FP7 program, addresses all of these issues through an articulated action plan aimed at building a network of European RD biobanks. Ultimately, RD-Connect will offer access to precious, quality-controlled biological samples from RD patients through an online, searchable, dynamic catalogue in the context of an integrated platform that links RD patient registries to biobanks and to clinical bioinformatics data for RD research.",,,"Animals;Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Factual;Europe;Humans;Rare Diseases;Research;Specimen Handling"
713,Digital pathology and image analysis augment biospecimen annotation and biobank quality assurance harmonization.,"Bih-Rong Wei,R Mark Simpson",,,,,2013,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24362266/,"Standardization of biorepository best practices will enhance the quality of translational biomedical research utilizing patient-derived biobank specimens. Harmonization of pathology quality assurance procedures for biobank accessions has lagged behind other avenues of biospecimen research and biobank development. Comprehension of the cellular content of biorepository specimens is important for discovery of tissue-specific clinically relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. While rapidly emerging technologies in molecular analyses and data mining create focus on appropriate measures for minimizing pre-analytic artifact-inducing variables, less attention gets paid to annotating the constituent makeup of biospecimens for more effective specimen selection by biobank clients. Both pre-analytic tissue processing and specimen composition influence acquisition of relevant macromolecules for downstream assays. Pathologist review of biorepository submissions, particularly tissues as part of quality assurance procedures, helps to ensure that the intended target cells are present and in sufficient quantity in accessioned specimens. This manual procedure can be tedious and subjective. Incorporating digital pathology into biobank quality assurance procedures, using automated pattern recognition morphometric image analysis to quantify tissue feature areas in digital whole slide images of tissue sections, can minimize variability and subjectivity associated with routine pathologic evaluations in biorepositories. Whole-slide images and pathologist-reviewed morphometric analyses can be provided to researchers to guide specimen selection. Harmonization of pathology quality assurance methods that minimize subjectivity and improve reproducibility among collections would facilitate research-relevant specimen selection by investigators and could facilitate information sharing in an integrated network approach to biobanking.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Specimen Handling;Translational Research, Biomedical;Biological specimen bank;Biomarkers;Computer-assisted diagnosis;Isolation and purification;Morphometry;Pattern recognition image analysis;Quantitative pathology;Standards"

The use of biospecimens is strictly controlled by ethical assessment, which complies with the laws of the country. These laws regulate the partnerships between the biobanks and industrial actors. However, private-public partnerships (PPP) can be limiting for several reasons, which can hamper the discovery of new biological tests and new active molecules targeted to human diseases. The bottlenecks and roadblocks in establishing these partnerships include: poor organization of the biobank in setting up PPP, evaluation of the cost of human samples, the absence of experience on the public side in setting up contracts with industry, and the fact that public and private partners may not share the same objectives. However, it is critical, in particular for academic biobanks, to establish strong PPP to accelerate translational research for the benefits of patients, and to allow the sustainability of the biobank. The purpose of this review is to discuss the main bottlenecks and roadblocks that can hamper the establishment of PPP based on solid and trusting relationships.",,,"Biomedical Research;Cooperative Behavior;Drug Industry;Humans;Intellectual Property;Inventions;Public-Private Sector Partnerships;Translational Research, Biomedical"

718,Practice variation across consent templates for biobank research. a survey of German biobanks.,"Irene Hirschberg,Hannes Knüppel,Daniel Strech",,,,,2013,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24294219/," Informed, voluntary, and valid consent from biomaterial donors is a precondition for biobank research. Valid consent protects donors' rights and helps maintain public trust in biobank research. Harmonization of consent procedures in biobank research is needed, because of the widely shared vision on national and international networking of biobanks including data and sample sharing. So far, no study has assessed and compared the content of current consent forms especially for biobank research. The objective of this study was to perform a content analysis of consent forms in German biobanks. Based on ten guidelines for biomedical research, we developed an assessment matrix with 41 content issues that are potentially relevant for consent forms in biobank research. This assessment matrix was applied in a thematic text analysis to 30 consent documents of German biobanks identified via the German Biobank Registry in July 2012. Coverage of the 41 items in the assessed consent forms varied widely. For example, the items  Right to withdraw consent (without disadvantage),   Policy for genetic information/consent to genetic analyzes  and  International cooperation/transborder use  were addressed in 97, 40, and 23% of all 30 consent forms respectively. The number of items covered by a single consent form ranged from 9 to 36 (22-88% out of 41 items). Our findings serve as a starting point to reflect upon the spectrum of consent issues that must be addressed in biobank research. The findings show that the majority of consent forms for German biobanks, if not all, should be improved and harmonized to better support an informed and balanced choice of potential donors and to facilitate networking of biobanks. Best practice models for consent forms in biobank research should be developed and biobank operators need to be more aware of relevant consent issues.",,,biobank;broad consent;informed consent;research ethics;survey;thematic text analysis;tissue bank;

Human cancer tissues that are maintained in intravital biobanks (or living tissue banks) retain native tumor microenvironment, tissue architecture, hormone responsiveness and cell-to-cell signalling properties. Intravital biobanks replicate the structural complexity and heterogeneity of human cancers, making them an ideal platform for preclinical studies. The application of omics with intravital biobanks renders them more active, which makes it possible for the cancer-related evaluations to be dynamically monitored on a real-time basis. Integrating intravital biobank and modern omics will provide a useful tool for the discovery and development of new drugs or novel therapeutic strategies.

The current study utilized community-based participatory research to identify motivating factors and barriers that affect older African Americans' willingness to donate biospecimens. The standardized phone survey was administered to 78 African Americans who are 55 years old or older and live in the metropolitan Detroit area to assess their overall willingness to donate biospecimens and what factors were associated with it. The majority of the participants were willing to donate biospecimens, along with their personal information, for medical research and indicated that they did donate biospecimens when they were asked. However, African Americans were rarely asked to participate in biobanking programs. Furthermore, African Americans were not as concerned with research exploitation or as mistrusting of medical researchers as previously thought by the medical researchers. Even if African Americans were concerned over potential research exploitation or mistrust of medical researchers, these concerns or mistrust did not translate into an actual unwillingness to participate in biobanking programs. Rather, transparency in medical research and biobanking programs was more important when predicting African Americans' willingness to donate biospecimens for medical research. The findings suggest that underrepresentation of African Americans in current biobanking programs may not be due to their willingness/unwillingness to participate in such programs but rather due to a failure of medical researchers to approach them. Additionally, researchers and clinicians should focus on increasing the transparency of medical research and biobanking programs rather than changing African Americans' potential negative attitudes toward them.",,,"Black or African American;Aged;Attitude to Health;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Community-Based Participatory Research;Female;Health Behavior;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Male;Patient Participation;Specimen Handling;Surveys and Questionnaires"

722,A strategic plan for the second phase (2013-2015) of the Korea biobank project.,"Ok Park,Sang Yun Cho,So Youn Shin,Jae-Sun Park,Jun Woo Kim,Bok-Ghee Han",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24159540/,"The Korea Biobank Project (KBP) was led by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to establish a network between the National Biobank of Korea and biobanks run by university-affiliated general hospitals (regional biobanks). The Ministry of Health and Welfare started the project to enhance medical and health technology by collecting, managing, and providing researchers with high-quality human bioresources. The National Biobank of Korea, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, collects specimens through various cohorts and regional biobanks within university hospitals gather specimens from patients. The project began in 2008, and the first phase ended in 2012, which meant that there needed to be a plan for the second phase that begins in 2013. Consequently, professionals from within and outside the project were gathered to develop a plan for the second phase. Under the leadership of the planning committee, six working groups were formed to formulate a practical plan. By conducting two workshops with experts in the six working groups and the planning committee and three forums in 2011 and 2012, they have developed a strategic plan for the second phase of the KBP. This document presents a brief report of the second phase of the project based on a discussion with them. During the first phase of the project (2008-2012), a network was set up between the National Biobank of Korea and 17 biobanks at university-affiliated hospitals in an effort to unify informatics and governance among the participating biobanks. The biobanks within the network manage data on their biospecimens with a unified Biobank Information Management System. Continuous efforts are being made to develop a common standard operating procedure for resource collection, management, distribution, and personal information security, and currently, management of these data is carried out in a somewhat unified manner. In addition, the KBP has trained and educated professionals to work within the biobanks, and has also carried out various publicity promotions to the public and researchers. During the first phase, biospecimens from more than 300,000 participants through various cohorts and biospecimens from more than 200,000 patients from hospitals were collected, which were distributed to approximately 600 research projects. The planning committee for the second phase evaluated that the first phase of the KBP was successful. However, the first phase of the project was meant to allow autonomy to the individual biobanks. The biobanks were able to choose the kind of specimens they were going to collect and the amount of specimen they would set as a goal, as well as being allowed to choose their own methods to manage their biobanks (autonomy). Therefore, some biobanks collected resources that were easy to collect and the resources needed by researchers were not strategically collected. In addition, there was also a low distribution rate to researchers outside of hospitals, who do not have as much access to specimens and cases as those in hospitals. There were also many cases in which researchers were not aware of the KBP, and the distribution processes were not set up to be convenient to the demands of researchers. Accordingly, the second phase of the KBP will be focused on increasing the integration and cooperation between the biobanks within the network. The KBP plans to set goals for the strategic collection of the needed human bioresources. Although the main principle of the first phase was to establish infrastructure and resource collection, the key objective of the second phase is the efficient utilization of gathered resources. In order to fully utilize the gathered resources in an efficient way, distribution systems and policies must be improved. Vitalization of distribution, securing of high-value resource and related clinical and laboratory information, international standardization of resource management systems, and establishment of a virtuous cycle between research and development (R&D) and biobanks are the four main strategies. Based on these strategies, 12 related objectives have been set and are planned to be executed.",,,Korea Biobank Project;National Biobank of Korea;biobank;biobank network;biospecimen;

An emerging area of concern in the field of prostate cancer biobanking is an apparent shift in the proportion of surgical procedures performed for prostate cancer treatment from radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Our study aimed to determine the potential impact of the RALP procedure on the detection of known prostate cancer biomarkers, and the subsequent suitability of RALP-derived specimens for prostate cancer biomarker studies. DNA and RNA were extracted from RRP and RALP specimens. Quality assessment was conducted using spectrophotometric analysis and RNA was analyzed for RNA integrity number (RIN) and by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for racemase, hepsin, ERG, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions, and the microRNAs miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-141, and miR-221. We demonstrate that extraction of derivatives from frozen tissues from RRP and RALP specimens yields samples of equally high quality as assessed by spectrophotometric and RIN analysis. Likewise, expression levels of genes analyzed by qRT-PCR did not differ between RRP and RALP-derived tissues. Our studies indicate that samples obtained from RALP specimens may be suitable for prostate cancer biomarker studies-an important finding given the current shift in surgical procedures for prostate cancer treatment.",,,Aged;Humans;Laparoscopy;Male;Middle Aged;Prostatectomy;Prostatic Neoplasms;Robotics;Tissue Banks;DNA;RNA;biobanking;biomarker;biorepository;prostate cancer;

Recently, semantic web technologies such as ontologies have been found useful in retrieving research data from biobanks. However, recent research has also shown that there is a lack of data about the administrative aspects of biobanks. These data would be helpful to answer research-relevant questions such as what is the scope of specimens collected in a biobank, what is the curation status of the specimens, and what is the contact information for curators of biobanks. Our use cases include giving researchers the ability to retrieve key administrative data (e.g. contact information, contact's affiliation, etc.) about the biobanks where specific specimens of interest are stored. Thus, our goal is to provide an ontology that represents the administrative entities in biobanking and their relations. We base our ontology development on a set of 53 data attributes called MIABIS, which were in part the result of semantic integration efforts of the European Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI). The previous work on MIABIS provided the domain analysis for our ontology. We report on a test of our ontology against competency questions that we derived from the initial BBMRI use cases. Future work includes additional ontology development to answer additional competency questions from these use cases. We created an open-source ontology of biobank administration called Ontologized MIABIS (OMIABIS) coded in OWL 2.0 and developed according to the principles of the OBO Foundry. It re-uses pre-existing ontologies when possible in cooperation with developers of other ontologies in related domains, such as the Ontology of Biomedical Investigation. OMIABIS provides a formalized representation of biobanks and their administration. Using the ontology and a set of Description Logic queries derived from the competency questions that we identified, we were able to retrieve test data with perfect accuracy. In addition, we began development of a mapping from the ontology to pre-existing biobank data structures commonly used in the U.S. In conclusion, we created OMIABIS, an ontology of biobank administration. We found that basing its development on pre-existing resources to meet the BBMRI use cases resulted in a biobanking ontology that is re-useable in environments other than BBMRI. Our ontology retrieved all true positives and no false positives when queried according to the competency questions we derived from the BBMRI use cases. Mapping OMIABIS to a data structure used for biospecimen collections in a medical center in Little Rock, AR showed adequate coverage of our ontology.",,,

Genome-wide association studies and disease-specific genetic research might reveal information about individual participants that are not related to the research purpose, but may be relevant to those participants' future health. In this article, we provide a synopsis of arguments for and against the disclosure of IFs in biobank research. We argue that arguments that do not distinguish between communications about pathogenic conditions and complex genetic risk for diseases fail, as preferences and decisions may be far more complex in the latter case. The principle of beneficence, for example, often supports the communication of incidentally discovered diseases, but if communication of risk is different, the beneficence of such communication is not equally evident. By conflating the latter form of communication with the former, the application of ethical principles to IFs in biobank research sometimes becomes too easy and frictionless. Current empirical surveys of people's desire to be informed about IFs do not provide sufficient guidance because they rely on the same notion of risk communication as a form of communication about actual health and disease. Differently designed empirical research and more reflection on biobank research and genetic risk information is required before ethical principles can be applied to support the adoption of a reasonable and comprehensive policy for handling IFs.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Empirical Research;Genetic Research;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Incidental Findings;Policy Making;Risk Factors;

Such governance is essential to ensuring that donors are protected, that cultural perspectives are respected and that researchers have a ready availability of ethically sourced biological samples. A literature review of all legislation, regulations, guidelines and standard operating procedures on informed consent, confidentiality and the transfer of biological samples amongst countries in Sub-Saharan Africa was conducted. In addition, an examination of the websites of departments of health and national ethics committees was performed. Researchers and research ethics scholars in the field in various African countries were contacted for assistance. A literature review of all studies examining participants views on issues related to biobanking in Africa was carried out and five separate studies were found. It was found that biobanking guidelines differ substantially across Sub-Saharan Africa regarding biobanking and often conflicted across borders. This has the potential to negatively impact collaboration. Furthermore, the guidelines in place often do not recognise the ethical difficulties arising from the transfer of biological samples and are unsuitable to regulate biobanks. Additionally, there is insufficient research into the views of research participants and stakeholders on the use of biological /samples. Collaboration is necessary to ensure the success of biobanking projects in Africa. To achieve this, there should be some harmonization of guidelines across Africa which would aid in transferring biological samples across borders. These guidelines should reflect the unique ethical issues arising out of the storage and secondary uses of biological samples. Finally, further research into the views of research participants is necessary. Such studies should aid in the drafting of any new harmonization guidelines.",,,"Africa South of the Sahara;Biological Specimen Banks;Clinical Governance;Confidentiality;Cultural Characteristics;Ethics Committees, Research;Ethics, Institutional;Genetic Privacy;Genetic Research;Guidelines as Topic;Humans;Informed Consent;International Cooperation;Research Personnel;Research Subjects"

However, demands are often made for which the legal implementation is at least contentious and can be considered as excessive and biased. In part 2 of this review series the current legal foundation of data protection and informed consent is summarized on the basis of normative and ethical principles. With respect to appropriation of data and biosamples it can be deduced that by conformation to corresponding framework conditions the informed consent of donors in particular can be constructed independent of the project.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Computer Security;Ethics Committees;Germany;Humans;Informed Consent;National Health Programs;

Yet although consent is the primary justification to use biobank samples and data, the Biobank Act allows asking for a consent for several unspecified future research purposes. The guiding principles of the Biobank Act are promotion of trust, equal access to data and samples, protection of privacy, acceleration of innovation activities, and bringing biobank activities under public scrutiny.

It was previously reported that only two-thirds of Jordanians expressed interest in biobanking. To promote public involvement in a biobank, it is imperative to determine the aspects that influence the decision-making to participate. On the basis of a national survey involving 3196 respondents, the influence of 13 biobanking factors was assessed, including returning research results, privacy, freedom of choice, uncertainties about research, monetary and health considerations, and personal belief. Perception toward each factor was also correlated with willingness to participate in a biobank. A considerable number of respondents indicated returning research results as influential in their decision to become biobank donors. Interestingly, whereas the positive perception of availability of general results (39%) correlated with willingness to donate for biobanking, the negative view of unavailability of individualized results (47%) did not correlate with unwillingness. Religious permission of sample donation for research had the strongest positive influence (61%) and the highest correlation to participate among positively perceived factors. Unspecified research was highly indicated as a negative factor (45%), but did not correlate with unwillingness to become a biobank donor, whereas allowed withdrawal had a positive effect (31%) and correlation to contribute to biobanking. The negative perception of accessing medical information (9.5%) and re-contact (8.5%) had the strongest correlation with unwillingness to donate to a biobank.

We aimed to design a multisource informed consent procedure that is easily adaptable to both clinical and research applications, and to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of understanding and awareness, even in less educated patients. We designed a multisource informed consent procedure for patients' enrolment in a Cancer Institute Biobank (CRO-Biobank). From October 2009 to July 2011, a total of 550 cancer patients admitted to the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS Aviano, who agreed to contribute to its biobank, were consecutively enrolled. Participants were asked to answer a self-administered questionnaire aim at exploring their understanding of biobanks and their needs for information on this topic, before and after study participation. Chi-square tests were performed on the questionnaire answers, according to gender or education. Of the 430 patients who returned the questionnaire, only 36.5% knew what a biobank was before participating in the study. Patients with less formal education were less informed by some sources (the Internet, newspapers, magazines, and our Institute). The final assessment test, taken after the multisource informed consent procedure, showed more than 95% correct answers. The information received was judged to be very or fairly understandable in almost all cases. More than 95% of patients were aware of participating in a biobank project, and gave helping cancer research (67.5%), moral obligation, and supporting cancer care as main reasons for their involvement. Our multisource informed consent information system allowed a high rate of understanding and awareness of study participation, even among less-educated participants, and could be an effective and easy-to-apply model for others to consider to contribute to a well-informed decision making process in several fields, from clinical practice to research.Further studies are needed to explore the effects on the study comprehension by each source of information, and by other sources suggested by participants in the questionnaire.",,,"Adult;Aged;Awareness;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Comprehension;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Multimedia;Neoplasms;Patients;Practice Patterns, Physicians';Research Design;Research Subjects;Surveys and Questionnaires;Tissue Banks"

A qualitative study was conducted to explore 568 cardiac care patients' explanations of why they declined to contribute their samples to a future genomic research biobank. To (1) identify themes emerging from explanations for declining contribution to the research biobanking initiative and (2) determine how the content informs the stewardship conceptual framework that addresses evidence-based clinical ethics practices in genomic and genetic research biobanking. This qualitative study used an analytic method that combines inductive and deductive approaches to identify themes in patients' explanations for declining to contribute to a research biobank initiative. The hybrid design has relevance to health services research that seeks to develop taxonomy, themes, and theory. Inductive approaches showed that themes of intrusion and autonomy dominated explanations. Deductive approaches affirmed previously proposed elements of a stewardship conceptual framework that addresses ethics in biobanking.

Informed consent understanding was measured by adapting the Quality of Informed Consent assessment to our study. We evaluated possible predictors of individual Quality of Informed Consent items using generalized estimating equations. A total of 252 individuals representing 188 families completed the study. The Quality of Informed Consent items best understood by parents included consent to participate in research, the main purpose of the study, and the possibility of no direct benefit. The items least understood by parents were those involving the indefinite storage of DNA, the possible risks of participation, and the fact that the study was not intended to treat their child's heart defect. Parent age and medical decision making by one versus both parents were frequent predictors of individual Quality of Informed Consent items.

Biobank research cannot be conducted without considering arguments for obtaining the donors' consent: in this paper we discuss to what extent consent in biobank research on oncological residual materials has to be required, and what type of consent would be appropriate in this context, considering the ethical principles of donation, solidarity, protection of the donors' rights and the requirements of scientific progress. Regarding the relationship between informed consent and tissue collection, storage and research, we have focused on two possible choices related to the treatment of data and samples in the biobank: irreversible and reversible anonymization of the samples, distinguishing between biobank research on residual materials for which obtaining consent is necessary and justified, and biobank research for which it is not. The procedures involve different approaches and possible solutions that we will seek to define. The consent for clinical research reported in the Helsinki Declaration regards research involving human beings and for this reason it is subordinate to specific and detailed information on the research projects. An important ethical aspect in regard to the role of Biobanks is encouraging sample donation. For donors, seeing human samples being kept rather than discarded, and seeing them become useful for research highlights the importance of the human body and improves the attitude towards donation. This process might also facilitate the giving of informed consent more willingly, and with greater trust.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Confidentiality;Humans;Informed Consent;Neoplasms;Patient Rights;Social Responsibility;

We collected fresh blood samples without RNA preservative in heparin, EDTA, or citrate and held them at room temperature for ≤ 24 hr before fractionating them into buffy coat, erythrocytes, and plasma and freezing the fractions at -80oC or in liquid nitrogen. We developed methodology for isolating RNA from the buffy coats and conducted omic analyses. Finally, we analyzed analogous samples from the EPIC-Italy and Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study biobanks. Microarray-quality RNA could be isolated from buffy coats (including most biobank samples) that had been frozen within 8 hr of blood collection by thawing the samples in RNA preservative. Different anticoagulants influenced the metabolomic, proteomic, and to a lesser extent transcriptomic profiles. Transcriptomic profiles were most affected by the delay (as little as 2 hr) before blood fractionation, whereas storage temperature had minimal impact. Effects on metabolomic and proteomic profiles were noted in samples processed ≥ 8 hr after collection, but no effects were due to storage temperature. None of the variables examined significantly influenced the epigenomic profiles. No systematic influence of time-in-storage was observed in samples stored over a period of 13-17 years.

Once consensus is reached among the participating biobanks, the SJH biobank liaises with the Research and Ethics Committees, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, The National Cancer Registry (NCR), patient advocate groups, researchers, and other stakeholders. The NCR provides de-identified data from its database for researchers via unique biobank codes. ELSI issues discussed include the introduction of prospective consent across the network and the return of significant research results to patients. Only 4 of 363 patients opted to be re-contacted and re-consented on each occasion that their samples are included in a new project. It was decided, after multidisciplinary discussion, that results will not be returned to patients. The SAP is modeled on those of several international networks. Biobank Ireland is affiliated with international biobanking groups-Marble Arch International Working Group, ISBER, and ESBB. The Irish government continues to deliberate on how to fund and implement biobanking nationally. Meanwhile BIT uses every opportunity to promote awareness of the benefits of biobanking in events and in the media.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Documentation;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internationality;Ireland;Neoplasms;Registries;

Some are established intentionally to address particular research needs; many, however, have arisen opportunistically, in a variety of settings and with a variety of expectations regarding their functions and longevity. Despite their rising prominence, little is known about how biobanks are organized and function beyond simple classification systems (government, academia, industry). In 2012, we conducted the first national survey of biobanks in the U.S., collecting information on their origins, specimen collections, organizational structures, and market contexts and sustainability. From a list of 636 biobanks assembled through a multi-faceted search strategy, representatives from 456 U.S. biobanks were successfully recruited for a 30-minute online survey (72% response rate). Both closed and open-ended responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. While nearly two-thirds of biobanks were established within the last decade, 17% have been in existence for over 20 years. Fifty-three percent listed research on a particular disease as the most important reason for establishment; 29% listed research generally. Other reasons included response to a grant or gift, and intent to centralize, integrate, or harmonize existing research structures. Biobank collections are extraordinarily diverse in number and types of specimens and in sources (often multiple) from which they are obtained, including from individuals, clinics or hospitals, public health programs, and research studies. Forty-four percent of biobanks store pediatric specimens, and 36% include postmortem specimens. Most biobanks are affiliated in one or multiple ways with other entities: 88% are part of at least one or more larger organizations (67% of these are academic, 23% hospitals, 13% research institutes). The majority of biobanks seem to fill a particular 'niche' within a larger organization or research area; a minority are concerned about competition for services, although many are worried about underutilization of specimens and long-term funding. Effective utilization of biobank collections and effective policies to govern their use will require understanding of the immense diversity found in organizational features, including the very different history and primary goals that many biobanks have.",,,Biobank;biorepository;governance;survey;
751,A solidarity-based approach to the governance of research biobanks.,"Barbara Prainsack,Alena Buyx",,,,,2013,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325780/,"New opportunities for large-scale data linkage and data-mining have rendered biobanks one of the core resources of medical research in the twenty-first century. At the same time, research biobanking has been seen to pose particular ethical and legal challenges pertaining to, for example, data protection, and the minimisation of other risks for participants. These measures have in turn led to heavy administrative, logistical, and financial costs and attracted criticism for unduly impeding disease research. Based on a newly formulated approach to solidarity, we propose an approach to governance that recognises people's willingness to participate in a public research biobank, and poses stronger emphasis on harm mitigation. We argue that such a model avoids some of the pitfalls of previous approaches. It also allows moving beyond overly restrictive and burdensome, exclusively autonomy-based governance towards governance that is reflective of people's willingness to accept costs to assist others.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Compensation and Redress;Europe;Feedback;Humans;Informed Consent;Personal Autonomy;

Up until now, a 'broad consent' model has been used in many present-day biobank projects. However it has been, by some scholars, deemed as a pragmatic, and not an acceptable ethical solution. Calls for change have been made on the basis of avoidance of paternalism, intentions to fulfil the principle of autonomy, wish for increased user participation, a questioning of the role of experts and ideas advocating reduction of top-down governance. Recently, an approach termed 'dynamic consent' has been proposed to meet such challenges. Dynamic consent uses modern communication strategies to inform, involve, offer choices and last but not the least obtain consent for every research projects based on biobank resources. At first glance dynamic consent seems appealing, and we have identified six claims of superiority of this model; claims pertaining to autonomy, information, increased engagement, control, social robustness and reciprocity. However, after closer examination, there seems to be several weaknesses with a dynamic consent approach; among others the risk of inviting people into the therapeutic misconception as well as individualizing the ethical review of research projects. When comparing the two models, broad consent still holds and can be deemed a good ethical solution for longitudinal biobank research. Nevertheless, there is potential for improvement in the broad model, and criticism can be met by adapting some of the modern communication strategies proposed in the dynamic consent approach.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Disclosure;Humans;Informed Consent;
753,About the new significance and the contingent meaning of biological material and data in biobanks.,"Michaela Th Mayrhofer",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24779112/,"Since the end of the 1990s, the practice of biobanking--performed in and by actors called biobanks--has become a key practice for the life sciences and the biotechnologies, though the practice of biobanking is far from being something entirely new. Its significance, however, is indeed new, in the sense that the biological material and associated data collected in, and manipulated by, well-organised and often highly specialised facilities is transformed into an (epistemic) object with biovalue. In other words, the practice of biobanking signifies not only the collection, manipulation, and distribution of biological material and associated data in an organised manner involving various actors that govern or use the services of a biobank. Rather, it produces biobanks as sites of co-production of data-driven scientific knowledge. My paper draws on case studies of the history and practices of Généthon DNA and Cell Bank, the Biobank of Picardie, and the Tumour Bank of the Saint-Louis Hospital in a comparative manner. It presents biobanking as both a contingent practice and of an open, experimental character and concludes that it is transforming into a data-driven practice pursued in an industrialized manner.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;France;Tissue Banks;

The main databases were searched using relevant keywords. Studies were included if peer-reviewed, in English and describing the reasons to enroll was provided by actual and apparently healthy donors. Although the 13 studies retrieved were heterogeneous, a scheme summarizing the main aspects involved in the decision-making process was developed. Expectation of personal benefit through health-related information was found in eight studies. Three of them discussed whether this expectation could be considered a form of therapeutic misconception.

However, we encountered two problems with this population. First, no common definition of biobanks exists. Second, no census is available of these facilities from which to sample in order to implement a survey. In light of these problems, we employed a multifaceted approach using electronic searches of PubMed, RePORTER, and Google. In addition, we systematically searched for biobanks housed within universities that have NIH-designated Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We expanded this part of the search by looking for biobanks among all members of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). Finally, we added banks to our database found previously by other researchers and banks found via correspondence with our colleagues. Our search strategy produced a database of 624 biobanks for which we were able to confirm contact information in order to conduct our online survey. Another 140 biobanks were identified but did not respond to our requests to confirm their existence or contact information. In order to maximize both the uniqueness of banks found and the greatest return on effort for each search, we suggest targeting resources that are already organized. In our work, these included the CTSA, AAMC, and part of the Google searches. We contend that our search provides a model for analysis of new fields of research and/or rapidly evolving industries. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates that with the appropriate tools it is possible to develop a systematic and comprehensive database to investigate undefined populations.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Data Collection;Databases as Topic;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Translational Research, Biomedical;United States"
756,Spanish regulatory approach for biobanking.,"Javier Arias-Diaz,María C Martín-Arribas,Javier García del Pozo,Carlos Alonso",,,,,2012,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23188043/,"The Spanish regulatory framework for storage of samples for research responds to most issues raised by both researchers and society regarding biobanking. The Spanish regulation currently foresees three possible ways in which these samples are to be handled: (a) gathering for use in a specific project, (b) storage in a collection, and (c) storage in a Biobank. Samples incorporated into a 'collection' can only be used by the investigator who requested them and cannot be transferred to third parties or used in research projects outside the particular research line foreseen in the original consent. On the other hand, the legal entity 'Biobank' refers not only to a set of physical facilities but to the management of the samples stored under that label, and particularly to the requirements for their cession. An approach based on putting most of the regulatory weight on the biobank side has been chosen in order to guaranty the rights of the donors as well as to ease the task of the researchers. A Biobank requires both to be authorized and to be registered in a public Registry. The requirements are quite stringent, allowing for the consent to be given as 'broad' in scope without implying being 'blank.' In this regard, for Biobanks to justify the taking on of some of the donors' rights, a key requirement is to have an external ethics committee supervising the adequacy of samples cession and use, notwithstanding the need for a previous bioethical supervision of the target protocol.",,,Bioethics;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Government Agencies;Humans;Informed Consent;Spain;

Little is known about the factors influencing participation in biobanks. This study compares the characteristics of biobank participants with those of non-participants, among members of an existing cohort study. Individuals aged 45 and over participating in The 45 and Up Study and living ≤20km from central Wagga Wagga, New South Wales (NSW), Australia (rural/regional area) or ≤10km from central Parramatta, NSW (urban area) (n=2340) were invited to join a biobank, giving a blood sample and having additional measures taken, including height, weight, waist circumference, heart rate and blood pressure. The overall uptake of the invitation to participate was 33% (762/2340). The response rate was 41% (410/1002) among participants resident in the regional area, and 26% (352/1338) among those resident in the urban area. Characteristics associated with significantly decreased participation were being aged 80 and over versus being aged 45-64 (participation rate ratio: RR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.34-0.60), not being born in Australia versus being born in Australia (0.69, 0.59-0.81), having versus not having a major disability (0.54, 0.38-0.76), having full-time caregiving responsibilities versus not being a full-time carer (0.62, 0.42-0.93) and being a current smoker versus never having smoked (0.66, 0.50-0.89). Factors associated with increased participation were being in part-time work versus not being in paid work (1.24, 1.07-1.44) and having an annual household income of ≥$50,000 versus <$20,000 (1.50, 1.26-1.80). A range of socio-economic, health and lifestyle factors are associated with biobank participation among members of an existing cohort study, with factors relating to health-seeking behaviours and access difficulties or time limitations being particularly important. If more widespread participation in biobanking is desired, particularly to ensure sufficient numbers among those most affected by these issues, specific efforts may be required to increase participation in certain groups such as migrants, the elderly, and those in poor health.

Sample integrity has been identified as a key factor that contributes to improved reproducibility. The key mission of biobanks is to ensure that all activities and materials are managed according to standardized procedures and best practices to ensure and preserve sample integrity. When handling large numbers of biospecimens automation of sample handling and storage is often the method of choice to maintain and improve sample integrity. In December 2013, the centralized Biobank of the University Hospitals and the Catholic University of Leuven (UZ KU Leuven) decided to implement automated systems for sample storage and retrieval, one for storage at -20°C and one for storage at -80°C. Here we describe the extensive process of installation, acceptance, validation, and implementation of these two systems. Overall it took about 4 years to effectively take the systems into production. Multiple issues resulted in the delayed implementation, with labware change, quality of the initial installation, and misunderstanding of biobank concerns being the most impacting. Significant effort in terms of time and resources from both the automated store supplier as well as the biobank itself was needed to achieve a successful implementation. Within 15 months of actual integration in the biobank workflow, over 63 k samples were placed into the systems. Actual hands-on sample handling and retrieval times were substantially reduced, although this implied the shift of dedicated personnel time from the researchers' laboratories to the biobank.

To address this, the University Biobank Limburg (UBiLim) was founded by a collaboration between Hasselt University, the Hospital East-Limburg, and the Jessa Hospital. This paper describes the evolution of this process and the barriers encountered on the way. UBiLim evolved from an archival collection over a single-site biobank into a federated structure, supporting translational research at the founding institutions. Currently, UBiLim is a federated biobank, with an established organizational structure and processing, and storage facilities at each of the three sites. All activities are integrated in an ISO15189-accredited Quality Management System and based on (inter)national biobank guidelines. Common methods for processing and storage of a plethora of sample types, suitable for state-of-the-art applications, were validated and implemented. Because the biobank is embedded in two hospitals, the request of researchers to include certain sample types or enroll specific patient groups can quickly be met. Funding has been a major challenge in each step of its evolution and remains the biggest issue for long-term biobank sustainability. To a lesser extent, the Belgian legislation and the operational cost of information management system are also concerns for smooth biobank operations.

The World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Taipei (2016) highlights the possibility of encountering IF and requires that research on biospecimens address biobank feedback policies in their informed consent process, leaving open the possibility that the policy may be  no return . As clinicians and researchers begin to use these  resources , the possibility of finding clinically significant IF is becoming a reality. In line with the WMA's Declaration of Taipei, a pragmatic approach is needed to deal with the issue of returning IF in biobank governance. Indeed, the impacts and concerns associated with the return of IF differ across different stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Therefore, the framework governing IF return needs to be custom-built, taking into account the nature of each research project and the unique features of biobanks. To this end, in addition to facilitating biobank transparency, establishing an endurable and horizontal connection among biobanks and clinical institutions under a public health system will improve efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, subject to contemporary Taiwanese ethical and/or legal regulations, this article argues for the establishment of an updated framework for imaging-related and genetic-related IF return within the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), mainly based on a limited obligation to disclose life-threatening information revealed by imaging, but not genetic, information. After discussing some of the ethical, legal and social issues encountered by the TWB and accounting for the experiences of other international biobanks, we propose a systematic framework for returning IF, mainly on a  limited obligation  basis, which offers better and more comprehensive protection for biobank-participants' rights and health.",,,"Biobanks;Bioethics;EGF, Ethical Governance Framework;ELSI, Ethical, Legal and Social Implications;ESC, European Society of Cardiology;Framework;GNC, German National Cohort;GP, General Practitioners;IF, Incidental Findings;IRBs, Institutional Review Boards;Incidental finding;MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging;NHI, National Health Insurance;NIH, National Institutes of Health;P3G, Public Population Project in Genomics and Society;TWB, Taiwan Biobank;The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016);UNESCO, United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization;WMA, World Medical Association"

The Standard Preanalytical Code-an indicator of the preanalytical lifecycle of a biospecimen impacting the downstream analysis results-was already implemented in 50% of the biobanks while the other half intends future implementation. To assess and maintain the quality of their QMS, 62% of biobanks used self-assessment tools and 71% participated in proficiency testing schemes. The majority of biobanks had implemented procedures for general and biobank specific activities. However, policies regarding the business and sustainability aspect of biobank were only implemented in a limited number of biobanks. A clear desire for a peer-review audit was expressed by 69% of biobanks, with over half of them intending to implement the recently published biobank standard ISO20387. Overall, the biobanks of the BBMRI.be network have actively implemented a solid quality approach in their practices. The implementation of ISO 20387 may bring further professionalization of activities. Based on the needs expressed in this survey, the Quality working group will be setting up an audit program for the BBMRI.be biobanks, to enhance, harmonize and streamline their activities. On the whole, the biobanks in the BBMRI.be network are able to substantially contribute to translational research, as a primary facilitator guaranteeing high quality standards and reproducibility.",,,BBMRI.be;ISO 20387;QMS;audit;biobank;quality;survey;

The collection/storage of bio-specimens triggers several social, legal, and ethical implications where public attitudes can represent the core measurement/parameter in defining the most acceptable practices and ethical approaches when dealing with biobanks. The aim of this study was to explore and understand population's perspectives, expectations, and concerns toward biobanks in Jordan. A cross-sectional survey that included closed-ended questions was distributed among Jordanians. A total of 500 participants who are representative of the Jordanian population were included in this study. There was overwhelming support (>85%) for the establishment of biobanks in Jordan, and most of the participants agreed on the importance of biobanks and samples' donation for promoting medical research. Enthusiasm in biobanking participation was associated with the sociodemographic characteristics of participants including age, educational level, and previous knowledge of biobanks. Moreover, considering sample donation as a religiously good deed appeared to have the strongest positive correlation with willingness to donate bio-specimens for future research. Also, participants' trust in medical and research services, especially the protection of their privacy and confidentiality, was the most critical concern when they decided to participate in biobanks. Population's attitude toward biobanks in Jordan was positive and promising, and can encourage the future establishment of different biobanks. It is also necessary to take into consideration certain sociodemographic characteristics when discussing specific information with potential biobanks' donors.",,,biorepositories;ethics;sample donation;sample reuse;sample storage;

Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic analyses of primary metabolism and complex lipids and targeted profiling of oxylipins, endocannabinoids, ceramides/sphingoid-bases, and bile acids were performed. Metabolite concentrations and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were compared, with the ideal protocol as the reference. Sixty-two percent of 428 identified compounds had good to excellent ICCs, a metric of concordance between measurements of samples handled with the different protocols. Sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, bile acids and fatty acid diols were the least affected by non-ideal handling, while sugars, organic acids, amino acids, monoacylglycerols, lysophospholipids, N-acylethanolamides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and numerous oxylipins were altered by delayed freezing. Freeze-thaw effects were assay-specific with lipids being most stable.

Objective: To question different healthy Colombian social agents about the perception they have on donating human biological material to be stored in a biobank for future research purposes. Materials and methods: We conducted an exploratory quantitative and qualitative research by means of an anonymous survey on healthy members of the Colombian community in order to evaluate their knowledge and stances related to biobanks. Results: Three hundred sixty-eight (368) individuals completed the survey, including health-care researchers, lawyers and members of research ethics committees. Ninety-six percent (96%) of the subjects stated their willingness to donate biological material to biobanks, although 60% expressed distress about their samples being used for certain research activities, mainly human cloning. Even though about half of the participants reported knowing what a biobank is, less than 3% of the individuals had a clear concept of them. Conclusion: Participants showed their willingness to donate and store their biological material for research purposes. Similarly, they expressed their opinion about issues related to the management of biobanks.

The startup of a biobank benefits from accreditation and stringent adherence to standards of practice. Fundamental to these practices is the protection of privacy and informed consent. A budget must be developed, and sources of funding should be obtained to properly equip the designated space and personnel. The appropriate space for freezers and for biospecimen processing should be identified.

Plasma and serum aliquots from 44 asymptomatic, non-diabetic human subjects were biobanked at -80°C for 7-9 months. Water T measurements were recorded at 37°C on 50 µL of unmodified plasma or serum using benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry. The T values for freshly drawn and once-frozen-thawed ( frozen ) samples were compared using Huber M-values (M), Lin concordance correlation coefficients (ρ), and Bland-Altman plots. Water T values from frozen plasma and serum samples were compared with >130 metabolic biomarkers and analyzed using multi-variable linear/logistic regression and ROC curves. Frozen plasma water T values were highly correlated with fresh (M=0.94, 95% CI 0.89, 0.97) but showed a lower level of agreement (ρ=0.74, 95% CI 0.62, 0.82) because of an average offset of -5.6% (-7.1% for serum). Despite the offset, frozen plasma water T was strongly correlated with markers of hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and inflammation and detected these conditions with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity (100%/63% for serum). Using optimized cut points, frozen plasma and serum water T detected hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and inflammation in 23 of 44 subjects, including nine with an early stage of metabolic dysregulation that did not meet the clinical thresholds for prediabetes or MetS. Plasma and serum water T values from once-frozen-thawed biobanked samples detect metabolic dysregulation with high sensitivity and specificity.

Ethics research aims to develop standards for governance to meet these challenges by elaborating overarching normative principles of medical ethics in the context of biobanking. Most ethical standards are widely agreed on among biobank stakeholders and entail specific governance solutions, for example, adoption of consent procedures. In order to fully meet its goal, every governance solution needs to be implemented, evaluated and, if necessary, adapted and improved in practice. This study reviews the scientific literature on biobank ethics and governance in order to identify studies that specifically focus on practice evaluation of biobank governance. A PubMed search was carried out. Retrieved literature was categorised and thematically clustered. All studies that focus on practice evaluation were reviewed and their objectives, results, and recommendations for practice summarised. The findings show that the majority of studies on biobank ethics and governance are theoretical; only 25 out of 922 studies empirically evaluate biobank governance in practice. The majority of these (14; 59%) focused on informed consent. Six studies (24%) addressed practice evaluation of sample and data access; the rest focused on public involvement, ethics reporting and incidental findings. Other relevant governance areas such as ethics review, priority setting and sample ownership were not addressed. In order to fulfil the ethical goals, more empirical research is needed that provides information on how governance mechanisms perform in practice and what improvements are needed.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Ethics, Research;Health Services Needs and Demand;Humans;Informed Consent;ethics;evidence based practice"
785,Impact of biobanks on research outcomes in rare diseases: a systematic review.,"Monique Garcia,Jenny Downs,Alyce Russell,Wei Wang",,,,,2018,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30419920/," Alleviating the burden of rare diseases requires research into new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We undertook a systematic review to identify and compare the impact of stand-alone registries, registries with biobanks, and rare disease biobanks on research outcomes in rare diseases. A systematic review and meta-aggregation was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (the PRISMA statement). English language publications were sourced from PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. Original research papers that reported clinical, epidemiological, basic or translational research findings derived from data contained in stand-alone registries, registries with biobanks, and rare disease biobanks were considered. Articles selected for inclusion were assessed using the critical appraisal instruments by JBI-QARI. Each article was read in its entirety and findings were extracted using the online data extraction software from JBI-QARI. Thirty studies including 28 rare disease resources were included in the review. Of those, 14 registries were not associated to biobank infrastructure, 9 registries were associated with biobank infrastructure, and 6 were rare disease biobank resources. Stand-alone registries had the capacity to uncover the natural history of disease and contributed to evidence-based practice. When annexed to biobank infrastructure, registries could also identify and validate biomarkers, uncover novel genes, elucidate pathogenesis at the Omics level, and develop new therapeutic strategies. Rare disease biobanks in this review had similar capacity for biological investigations, but in addition, had far greater sample numbers and higher quality laboratory techniques for quality assurance processes. We examined the research outcomes of three specific populations: stand-alone registries, registries with biobanks, and stand-alone rare disease biobanks and demonstrated that there are key differences among these resources. These differences are a function of the resources' design, aims, and objectives, with each resource having a distinctive and important role in contributing to the body of knowledge for rare disease research. Whilst stand-alone registries had the capacity to uncover the natural history of disease, develop best practice, replace clinical trials, and improve patient outcomes, they were limited in their capacity to conduct basic research. The role of basic research in rare disease research is vital; scientists must first understand the pathways of disease before they can develop appropriate interventions. Rare disease biobanks, on the other hand (particularly larger biobanks), had the key infrastructure required to conduct basic research, making novel Omics discoveries, identify and validate biomarkers, uncover novel genes, and develop new therapeutic strategies. However, these stand-alone rare disease biobanks did not collect comprehensive data or impact on clinical observations like a rare disease registry. Rare disease research is important not only for rare diseases, but also for also common diseases. For example, research of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptors in the rare disease known as familial hypercholesterolemia led to the discovery of statins, a drug therapy that is now used routinely to prevent heart disease. Rare diseases are still under-researched worldwide. This review made the important observation that registries with biobanks had the function of both stand-alone registries (the capacity to collect comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data) and stand-alone rare disease biobanks (the ability to contribute to Omics research). We found registries with biobanks offer a unique, practical, cost-effective, and impactful solution for rare disease research. Linkage of stand-alone registries to rare disease biobanks will provide the appropriate resources required for the effective translation of basic research into clinical practice. Furthermore, facilitators such as collaboration, engagement, blended recruitment, pro-active marketing, broad consent, and  virtual biobank  online catalogues will, if utilised, add to the success of these resources. These important observations can serve to direct future rare diseases research efforts, ultimately improve patient outcomes and alleviate the significant burden associated with rare disease for clinicians, hospitals, society, and most importantly, the patients and their families.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Rare Diseases;Registries;Biobank;Rare disease;Registries;Systematic review;

This study aimed to explore the attitudes, motivations, and concerns of both oncology patients and health care professionals (HCPs) regarding biobanking. Qualitative interviews were conducted with oncology patients and HCPs purposively selected from five Australian hospitals. Patients were invited to give biobanking consent as part of a clinical trial and/or for future research were eligible. HCPs were eligible if involved in consenting patients to biobanking or to donate specimens to clinical trials. Twenty-two patients participated, with head and neck (36%) and prostate (18%) the most common cancer diagnoses; all had consented to biobanking. Twenty-two HCPs participated, from across eight cancer streams and five disciplines. Themes identified were (a) biobanking is a  no brainer ; (b) altruism or scientific enquiry; (c) trust in clinicians, science, and institutions; (d) no consent-just do it; (e) respecting patient choice ( opt-out ); (f) respectful timing of the request; (g) need for emotional/family support; (h) context of the biobanking request matters; and (i) factors for biobanking success. These findings reinforced previous findings regarding high public trust in, and support for, biobanking. An initial opt-in consent approach with the option of later opt-out was favored by patients to respect and recognize donor generosity, whereas HCPs preferred an upfront opt-out model. Factors impacting biobanking success included the context of the request for use in a trial or specific research question, pre-existing patient and HCP rapport, a local institution champion, and infrastructure. Patients and health care professionals (HCPs) who experienced cancer biobanking consent were overwhelmingly supportive of biobanking. The motivations and approaches to seeking consent were largely mirrored between the groups. The findings of this study support the opt-in model of biobanking favored by patients; however, HCPs preferred an opt-out model. Both groups recognize the importance of making the request for biobanking at an appropriate time, preferably with emotional or family support, and respecting the timing of the request and privacy of the patient.

Recorded activity was assessed using wrist-worn accelerometers (2013-2015, n = 65,967) and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking, and walking for pleasure was self-reported (2006-2010, n = 337,822). Associations were assessed using linear and multinomial logistic regression models and data were analyzed in 2017. We found participants living in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution recorded and reported lower levels of physical activity and those in rural areas and more walkable areas had higher levels of both recorded and reported activity. Some associations varied according to the specificity of the outcome, for example, those living in the most deprived areas were less likely to record higher levels of MVPA (upper tertile: RRR: 0.80 95% CI: 0.74, 0.86) but were more likely to report higher levels of walking (upper tertile: RRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.13). Environmental characteristics have the potential to contribute to different physical activities but interventions which focus on a single environmental attribute or physical activity outcome may not have the greatest benefits.",,,Accelerometry;Adult;Aged;Environment Design;Exercise;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Residence Characteristics;Self Report;Surveys and Questionnaires;United Kingdom;Walking;Accelerometry;Environment;Physical activity;UK Biobank;Walking;

In this article, we summarize recent research on public engagement in order to describe the constitution of respective concerns as  engagement of knowledges.  By shifting the focus of analysis from  publics  to  knowledges,  we draw attention to the interaction dynamic through which citizens embed the new knowledge they receive during expert interactions into the stock of knowledge they already possess. Analyzing our recent investigation of public views on biobanking in the form of citizen-expert panels in the Austrian infrastructure of biobanks (BBMRI.at), we trace this dynamic through citizens' recurrent concerns that the research and consent practices related to biobanking should be  appropriate.

792,Are exposures to ready-to-eat food environments associated with type 2 diabetes? A cross-sectional study of 347 551 UK Biobank adult participants.,"Chinmoy Sarkar,Chris Webster,John Gallacher",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30318101/," Rapid urbanisation and associated socioeconomic transformations have modified current lifestyles, shifting dietary preferences towards ready-to-eat, calorie-dense food of poor nutritional quality. The effect of ready-to-eat food environments that sell food for instant consumption on the risk of type 2 diabetes has received scant attention. We therefore aimed to examine the association between exposure to ready-to-eat food environments and type 2 diabetes in a large and diverse population sample. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult male and female participants from the baseline phase of the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in this cohort were aged 37-73 years and resided in one of 21 cities in the UK. Ready-to-eat food environments, which we determined from a modelled and linked built environment database, were objectively measured within 1-km catchment areas of the residential streets of participants and were expressed as metrics of density and proximity to the participants' homes. We used logistic regression models to examine the associations between exposure to ready-to-eat food environments and the odds of type 2 diabetes, adjusting for individual covariates such as physical activity. As sensitivity analyses, we investigated the associations between the street distance to the nearest ready-to-eat food outlet and type 2 diabetes. We also tested post hoc for effect modification by sex, income, body-mass index, and location of the UK Biobank collection centre. Of 502 635 UK Biobank participants enrolled between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, the sample analysed included 347 551 (69·1%) participants. The density of ready-to-eat food environments within a 1-km catchment area was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes for participants in the groups with highest exposure to restaurants and cafeterias (odss ratio 1·129, 95% CI 1·05-1·21; p=0·0007) and a composite measure of ready-to-eat outlet density (1·112, 1·02-1·21; p=0·0134) compared with those with no exposure. Exposure to hot and cold takeaways was only significantly associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes at the second highest exposure category that we examined (1·076, 1·01-1·14; p=0·0171), representing a density of 0·75-2·15 units per km. A protective effect with distance decay was observed: participants in the highest quintile of street distance to nearest ready-to-eat food outlet reported lower odds of type 2 diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (0·842, 0·78-0·91; p<0·0001 for restaurants and cafeterias; and 0·913, 0·85-0·98; p=0·0173 for hot and cold takeaways). These effects were most pronounced in overweight participants (p=0·0329), but there was no evidence of interaction by sex, income, or UK Biobank collection centre. Access to ready-to-eat food environments was positively associated with type 2 diabetes. Top-down policies aimed at minimising unhealthy food access could potentially reduce unhealthy consumption and risks of chronic diseases.

This study sought to assess parents' willingness to enroll their children, and their perceived benefits, concerns, and information needs under different consent and data-sharing scenarios, and to identify factors associated with willingness. This large, experimental survey of patients at the 11 eMERGE Network sites used a disproportionate stratified sampling scheme to enrich the sample with historically underrepresented groups. Participants were randomized to receive one of three consent and data-sharing scenarios. In total, 90,000 surveys were mailed and 13,000 individuals responded (15.8% response rate). 5737 respondents were parents of minor children. Overall, 55% (95% confidence interval 50-59%) of parents were willing to enroll their youngest minor child in a hypothetical biobank; willingness did not differ between consent and data-sharing scenarios. Lower educational attainment, higher religiosity, lower trust, worries about privacy, and attitudes about benefits, concerns, and information needs were independently associated with less willingness to allow their child to participate. Of parents who were willing to participate themselves, 25% were not willing to allow their child to participate. Being willing to participate but not willing to allow one's child to participate was independently associated with multiple factors, including race, lower educational attainment, lower annual household income, public health care insurance, and higher religiosity.

Barriers to participation, which include age, location, cultural sensitivities around human tissue, and issues of literacy and language, can influence the diversity of samples found in biobanks. This has implications for the generalizability of research findings from biobanks being able to be translated into the clinic. Dynamic Consent, which is a digital decision-support tool, could improve participants' recruitment to, and engagement with, biobanks over time and help to overcome some of the barriers to participation. However, there are also risks that it may deepen the  digital divide  by favoring those with knowledge and access to digital technologies, with the potential to decrease participant engagement in research. When applying a Dynamic Consent approach in biobanking, researchers should give particular attention to adaptations that can improve participant inclusivity, and evaluate the tool empirically, with a focus on equity-relevant outcome measures. This may help biobanks to fulfill their promise of enabling translational research that is relevant to all.",,,Dynamic Consent;biobanks;communication;consent;equity;inclusive;participation;translation;

The aim of this study was to analyse the mechanisms of cryoinjuries in different placental tissues and bioengineered constructs as well as to support the viability after low temperature storage, which would contribute to development of efficient biobanking technologies. This study shows that specificity of cryodamage depends on the structure of the studied object, intercellular bonds, as well as interaction of its components with cryoprotective agents. Remarkably, it was possible to efficiently isolate cells after thawing from all of the studied tissues.

Transparent, effective, and efficient governance structures and procedures for access, compensation, and priority setting are needed, but recent debates indicate challenges in the practical application of such governance processes. This study aimed to assess the practical experiences and attitudes of biobank experts regarding the governance of biosample access, prioritization, and compensation. Qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 20 biobank directors from eight countries. Respondents highlighted the need for sound governance structures in order to ensure acceptance by all stakeholders (patients/donors, researchers, research funders, public, and others). They stressed practical difficulties in trying to make best use of biomaterials. As biobanks often form part of larger academic and clinical settings, the different and sometimes conflicting interests of researchers, clinicians, patients, funders, and biobank staff currently affect the governance of access decisions. Investments such as intellectual input, financial, and human resources need to be compensated adequately. Biobanks thereby have a dual role stewarding the hosted biosamples and acting as a service provider for local researchers from universities or hospitals. In order to facilitate efficient use of human biological materials, greater harmonization of at least minimum standards for access and compensation are required at both a national and an international level.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Facilities and Services Utilization;Humans;Surveys and Questionnaires;

Some biobanks, however, come to have scientific value that goes beyond the projects that were initially responsible for the collection of the samples and data they contain. Such value may derive from among other things the uniqueness of the samples in terms of their sheer volume, the quality of the samples, the ability to link the samples with information retrieved in disease registries, or the fact that the samples represent very rare diseases. This article focuses on biobanks of this kind, and the special obligations that publicly funded universities have to ensure the sustainability of biobanks with continued scientific value. We argue that universities should adopt policies to deal with the various, diverse issues which may arise during the lifecycle of a biobank. The policies should be flexible, accommodate the freedoms of individual researchers, and reflect the multifaceted nature of biobanks.

Participation in biobanks is characteristically based on broad consent that presupposes an ongoing possibility of informing and interacting with participants over time. The death of a participant means the end of any interaction, but usually not the end of participation. Research on causes of death makes biobank material from deceased participants extremely valuable. But as new research questions and methods develop over time, the question arises whether stored biobank material from deceased persons still can be used on the basis of their broad consent. In this paper, we discuss policies for postmortem use of biobank material, including consent options, proxy consent and criteria for limitation of types of use and duration of storage. We conclude that the interests of participants in biobank research are best served by asking at enrolment if and how the biobank material may be used after death. We state that the use of biobank material from deceased participants should be delimited both by their consent and by the prevailing broad consent choices of living participants.Biobanks also need to inform participants at enrolment about the duration of storage of biobank material or at minimum have procedures for deciding how long material will be stored for and for which purpose.

804,The Public's Awareness of and Attitude Toward Research Biobanks - A Regional German Survey.,"Sabine Bossert,Hannes Kahrass,Daniel Strech",,,,,2018,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881399/,"Biobanks have become an increasingly important means of biomedical research and innovation. However, they entail a variety of ethical, social and legal challenges, which need to be publicly discussed and managed collectively. A certain level of public awareness of biobank research is an important prerequisite for the public to form an opinion on the issue at hand and to be willing to participate in public engagement activities. For many countries, including Germany, recent information on the public's awareness of and attitude toward biobanks is scarce.  Therefore, by means of a postal survey in a German urban region, this study updates data from the 2010 Eurobarometer by analyzing (1) the public's awareness of biobanks, (2) their general attitude toward biobanks, and (3) their hypothetical willingness to donate their own biological samples and personal or medical data.  Overall, 204 (20.4%) of 998 delivered questionnaires were returned. The majority of survey respondents stated a positive attitude toward medical research (95.5%) and - to a somewhat lower degree - toward genetic research (61.3%). Attitudes toward biobanks were mixed but positive for the majority of respondents: in a question about their spontaneous assessment of biobanks as a means for medical research, 77% showed positive attitudes toward biobanks (36.6%  definitely  and 40.5%  somewhat positive ). This finding is also reflected in a high proportion of individuals willing to participate in biobank research: 70.4% of respondents would be willing to donate biomaterial to a biobank during a hypothetical stay in hospital. In spite of the high overall support respondents show for biobanks (e.g., positive general attitude and willingness to participate), only about one third (30.8%) had previously heard of biobanks.  The comparison of survey results with prior data from the 2010 Eurobarometer indicates that public awareness of biobanks remains low. A higher level of biobank awareness can be assumed to be one prerequisite for public engagement in future decisions on biobank governance. We therefore argue that to increase public awareness of biobanks and to enable public involvement in biobank governance, publicly available and understandable information must be provided and disseminated.",,,Germany;awareness of biobanks;biobank research;postal survey;public attitudes;

However, the evidence for identifying the optimum residential density in relation to obesity has been far from compelling. We examined the association of obesity with residential density in a large and diverse population sample drawn from the UK Biobank to identify healthy-weight-sustaining density environments. For this full-data, cross-sectional analysis, we used UK Biobank data for adult men and women aged 37-73 years from 22 cities across the UK. Baseline examinations were done between 2006 and 2010. Residential unit density was objectively assessed within a 1 km street catchment of a participant's residence. Other activity-influencing built environment factors were measured in terms of density of retail, public transport, and street-level movement density, which were modelled from network analyses of through movement of street links within the defined catchment. We regressed adiposity indicators of body-mass index (BMI; kg/m), waist circumference (cm), whole body fat (kg), and obesity (WHO criteria of BMI ≥30 kg/m) on residential density (units per km), adjusting for activity-influencing built environment factors and individual covariates. We also investigated effect modification by age, sex, employment status, and physical activity. We used a series of linear continuous and logistic regression models and non-linear restricted cubic spline models as appropriate. Of 502 649 adults in the prospective cohort, 419 562 (83·5%) participants across 22 UK Biobank assessment centres met baseline data requirements and were included in the analytic sample. The fitted restricted cubic spline adiposity-residential density dose-response curve identified a turning point at a residential density of 1800 residential units per km. Below a residential density of 1800 units per km, an increment of 1000 units per km was positively related with adiposity, being associated with higher BMI (β 0·19 kg/m, 95% CI 0·14 to 0·24), waist circumference (β 0·41 cm, 0·28 to 0·54), and whole body fat (β 0·40 kg, 0·30 to 0·50), and with increased odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1·10, 1·07 to 1·14). Beyond 1800 units per km, residential density had a protective effect on adiposity and was associated with lower BMI (β -0·22 kg/m, -0·25 to -0·20), waist circumference (β -0·54 cm, -0·61 to -0·48), and whole body fat (β -0·38 kg, -0·43 to -0·33), and with decreased odds of obesity (OR 0·91, 0·90 to 0·93). Subgroup analyses identified more pronounced protective effects of residential density among individuals who were younger, female, in employment, and accumulating higher levels of physical activity, except in the case of whole body fat, for which the protective effects were stronger in men. Housing-level policy related to the optimisation of healthy density in cities might be a potential upstream-level public health intervention towards the minimisation and offsetting of obesity; however, further research based on accumulated prospective data is necessary for evidencing specific pathways.

We have found a strong genome-wide genetic correlation between asthma and allergic diseases (r = 0.75, P = 6.84 × 10). Cross-trait analysis identified 38 genome-wide significant loci, including 7 novel shared loci. Computational analysis showed that shared genetic loci are enriched in immune/inflammatory systems and tissues with epithelium cells.

Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age of smoking initiation. The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that each standard deviation increment in body mass index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), P<0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P<0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002).

Mortality related to CVD was higher in winter, as were risk factors for this condition including blood pressure, markers of inflammation and body mass index (BMI). These seasonal rhythms were significantly related to day length after adjustment for other factors that might affect seasonality including physical activity, diet and outdoor temperature. The risk of CVD may be modulated by day length at temperate latitudes, and the implications of seasonality should be considered in all studies of human cardiometabolic health.

What they all have in common is that the goal of any biobanking must be to improve clinical, translational, and basic research. While in the past biomaterials often had to be individually stored for each research project, modern biobanking offers decisive advantages: a comprehensive ethics vote fulfilling state-of-the-art data safety requirements, standardized processing and storage protocols, specialized biobank software for pseudonymization and localization, protection against power failures and defects of the equipment, centralized and sustainable storage, easy localization and return of samples, and their destruction or anonymization after completion of an individual project. In addition to this important pure storage function, central biobanking can provide a link to clinical data as well as the anonymous use of samples for project-independent research. Both biobank functions serve different purposes, are associated with specific requirements, and should be pursued in parallel. If successful, central biomaterial management can achieve a sustainable improvement of academic and non-academic biomedical research and the optimal use of resources.

Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank. In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37-73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0·5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates. Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77·1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4·0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0·960, 95% CI 0·93-0·99; p=0·0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity. The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

However, the interpretation of such studies can be hampered by important issues such as confounding and reporting bias. We used the UK Biobank resource to develop genetic predictors of height and applied these in a Mendelian randomisation framework to estimate the causal relationship between height and cancer. Up to 438,870 UK Biobank participants were considered in our analysis. We addressed two primary cancer outcomes, cancer incidence by age ~60 and cancer mortality by age ~60 (where age ~60 is the typical age of UK Biobank participants). We found that each genetically predicted 9 cm increase in height conferred an odds ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.13) and 1.09 (1.02-1.16) for diagnosis of any cancer and death from any cancer, respectively. For both risk and mortality, the effect was larger in females than in males. Height increases the risk of being diagnosed with and dying from cancer.

This study explored if: (1) patients accept opt-in or opt-out consent models with varying levels of professional involvement; (2) professionals discuss participation with specific patient groups; and (3) this discussion is associated with patient knowledge of biobanking processes. Outpatients completed surveys at a tertiary cancer center in New South Wales, Australia. Eligible participants were English-speaking adults who recently had cancer-related surgery. Participants completed 27 questions exploring acceptable consent models, biobanking experiences, knowledge, and willingness. Logistic regression and chi-square tests examined differences in the characteristics and knowledge of participants who were offered the opportunity to participate versus those who were not. A total of 113 outpatients participated (97% response). Most participants (92%) found opt-out, patient-initiated consent acceptable; however, high acceptability was reported for all models except for opt-in, patient-initiated consent (58%). University or technical qualifications (P  =  0.001) was associated with increased odds (OR = 4.5) of being offered biobanking. The majority did not know what occurred to samples after surgery (59.3%) or pathology review (81.4%) and ability to answer these questions was associated with discussion of participation (P < 0.001). Of the few outpatients who discussed biobanking with their doctor (29%), all consented.

Given the scientific complexity associated with genomics, there is a growing recognition globally of the importance of science translation and community engagement (CE) for this type of research, as it creates the potential to build relationships, increase trust, improve consent processes and empower local communities. Despite this level of recognition, there is a lack of empirical evidence of the practise and processes for effective CE in genomic biobanking in Africa. To begin to address this vacuum, 17 in-depth face to face interviews were conducted with South African experts in genomic biobanking research and CE to provide insight into the process, benefits and challenges of CE in South Africa. Emerging themes were analysed using a contextualised thematic approach. Several themes emerged concerning the conduct of CE in genomic biobanking research in Africa. Although the literature tends to focus on the local community in CE, respondents in this study described three different layers of stakeholder engagement: community level, peer level and high level. Community level engagement includes potential participants, community advisory boards (CAB) and field workers; peer level engagement includes researchers, biobankers and scientists, while high level engagement includes government officials, funders and policy makers. Although education of each stakeholder layer is important, education of the community layer can be most challenging, due to the complexity of the research and educational levels of stakeholders in this layer. CE is time-consuming and often requires an interdisciplinary research team approach. However careful planning of the engagement strategy, including an understanding of the differing layers of stakeholder engagement, and the specific educational needs at each layer, can help in the development of a relationship based on trust between the research team and various stakeholder groups. Since the community layer often comprises vulnerable populations in low and middle income countries (LMICs), co-development of innovative educational tools on genomic biobanking is essential. CE is clearly a component of a broader process best described as stakeholder engagement.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Community Participation;Community-Based Participatory Research;Ethics, Research;Genome, Human;Genomics;Humans;Research Personnel;South Africa;Stakeholder Participation;Surveys and Questionnaires;Trust;Community engagement;Ethics;Genomic biobanking research;H3Africa"

The Radboud Biobank (RB) is a central clinical biobanking facility designed in accordance with the standards set by the Parelsnoer Institute, a Dutch national biobank originally initiated with eight different disease cohorts. To organize the information of these cohorts, we used our experience and knowledge in the field of biobanking and translational research to identify research domains and information categories to classify data. We extended this classification system to a stepwise procedure for defining a data collection framework and examined its utility for existing RB biobanks. Our approach resulted in the definition of a three-step procedure: (1) Identification of research domains and relevant questions within the field that may benefit from biobank samples. (2) Identification of information categories and accompanying subcategories that are relevant for answering questions in identified research domains. (3) Reduction to an efficient framework based on essentiality and quality criteria. We showed the utility of the procedure for three existing RB biobanks. We developed guidelines for the definition of a framework that supports the standardization of the biobank data collection process. Connecting the biobank database to pertinent information collected from the electronic health record will improve data quality and efficiency for both care and research. This is crucial when using the corresponding biospecimens for scientific research. Further, it also facilitates the combination of different clinical biobanks for a specific disease.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Data Collection;Databases, Factual;Humans;clinical biobank;data;electronic health record;framework;guidelines;standardization"

We sought to identify the genetic variants associated with a broadly-defined headache phenotype in 223,773 subjects from the UK Biobank cohort. We defined headache based on a specific question answered by the UK Biobank participants. We performed a genome-wide association study of headache as a single entity, using 74,461 cases and 149,312 controls. We identified 3343 SNPs which reached the genome-wide significance level of P<5×10. The SNPs were located in 28 loci, with the top SNP of rs11172113 in the LRP1 gene having a P value of 4.92×10. Of the 28 loci, 14 have previously been associated with migraine. Among 14 new loci, rs77804065 with a P value of 5.87×10 in the LINC02210-CRHR1 gene was the top SNP. Significant relationships between multiple brain tissues and genetic associations were identified through tissue expression analysis. We also identified significant positive genetic correlations between headache and many psychological traits. Our results suggest that brain function is closely related to broadly-defined headache. In addition, we found that many psychological traits have genetic correlations with headache.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Gene Expression Profiling;Genetic Loci;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Headache;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;United Kingdom;Genome-wide association study;Headache;LRP1;Tissue expression;UK biobank"

Here, we present RD-Connect Registry & Biobank Finder, a tool that helps RD researchers to find RD biobanks and registries and provide information on the availability and accessibility of content in each database. The finder concentrates information that is currently sparse on different repositories (inventories, websites, scientific journals, technical reports, etc.), including aggregated data and metadata from participating databases. Aggregated data provided by the finder, if appropriately checked, can be used by researchers who are trying to estimate the prevalence of a RD, to organize a clinical trial on a RD, or to estimate the volume of patients seen by different clinical centers. The finder is also a portal to other RD-Connect tools, providing a link to the RD-Connect Sample Catalogue, a large inventory of RD biological samples available in participating biobanks for RD research. There are several kinds of users and potential uses for the RD-Connect Registry & Biobank Finder, including researchers collaborating with academia and the industry, dealing with the questions of basic, translational, and/or clinical research.

Participants completed a survey before the deliberation and two surveys post-deliberation: one on (or just after) the deliberation day, and one 4 weeks later. Subjects were asked to rate 5 biobank consent policies as acceptable (or not) and to identify the best and worst policies. Analyses compared acceptability of different policy options and changes in attitudes across the three groups. After deliberation, subjects in the DD group were less likely to find broad consent (defined here as consent for the use of donations in an unspecified range of future research studies, subject to content and process restrictions) and study-by-study consent acceptable. The DD group was also significantly less likely to endorse broad consent as the best policy (OR = 0.34), and more likely to prefer alternative consent options.

The EU Horizon 2020 Project 'Genetics Clinic of the Future' surveyed European biobanks' perceptions of the legal and regulatory requirements for communicating individual research results to donors. The goal was to gain background knowledge for possible future guidelines, especially relating to the consent process. The Survey was implemented using a web-based Webropol tool. The questionnaire was sent at the end of 2015 to 351 European biobanks in 13 countries that are members of BBMRI-ERIC (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium). Seventy-two biobanks responded to the survey, representing each of the 13 BBMRI Member States. Respondents were mainly individuals responsible for the governance of biobanks. The replies indicate that the majority of the respondents thought that their national legislation allowed them to contact participants to communicate results, and that research participants had the right to request their results. However, respondents' understanding of their national legislation varied even within member states. Our results indicate that legislation applied to biobanks in many countries may be scattered and difficult to interpret.

However, these aims can be difficult to achieve under healthcare professionals' (HCPs) time-constrained workflows, resulting in low participation rates. This current perspective provides a brief overview of HCP involvement in consent and reports new data on participant attrition at each step of the biobanking consent process as experienced by 113 patients at an Australian tertiary cancer centre. To determine attrition in this HCP-driven consent process, we reviewed medical records for the following events: inclusion of biobanking consent forms; visible patient and HCP signatures; consent status selected (decline or accept) and specimen registration with local biobank. Accessible medical records revealed the following data: 75 of 85 records included viewable forms; 22 of 85 records included patient and 19 of 85 included HCP signatures; 15 of 85 records included signed and completed forms and 3 of 85 had samples banked with annotated clinical data. We compared these data with self-reported experiences of being approached to participate by HCPs. Of the 15 participants (17.6%) who successfully completed consent, only five could recall being asked and providing consent. The low enrolment rate is a considerable lost opportunity because most patients (59%) who were not asked to participate indicated they would have consented if asked. Furthermore, in comparing self-reported experiences with medical records, we believe cancer patients' preferences for participation are mismatched with actual biobanking enrolment, which has considerable attrition at each step in the consent process.",,,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Health Personnel;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Preference;Registries;Young Adult;Informed consent;Living donors;Neoplasm;Patient preference;Tissue banks;

Several countries and some international agencies have made formal efforts to standardize biobank operations and outputs. These include the establishment of best practice guidelines for collection management, and certification programs. Such guidelines and programs increase biobanks' opportunities for participation in high impact research and funding. However, they also impose economic and time costs, which may burden biobanks. This study aimed to estimate the costs of gaining certification and maintaining certification (i.e., committing extra resources to continue standards) for three cancer biobanks participating in a biobank certification program in New South Wales, Australia. To gather cost data for a range of cancer biobanks, we recruited three with different full time equivalent (FTE) staff levels (1.0-3.0), recognizing FTE staff level as an indicator of resources and operating scale. In extended interviews with staff, we gathered biobanks' expected costs in obtaining and annually maintaining certification. The biobank with the highest staff level reported the lowest expected costs in gaining certification, due to the strong prealignment of its present operations with certification requirements. The other biobanks expected higher costs as their operations required greater adjustments. Overall, relative costs of gaining certification were between 2% and 6% of current total annual wage costs. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such costing study of a biobank certification program. Supplementary Data include the interview schedule that other biobanks may use to estimate their own economic certification costs.",,,Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Certification;Humans;Practice Guidelines as Topic;biobanking;biobanking best practices;biobanking certification costs;biobanking certification program;

In addition, we assessed inter- and intra-assay variability between collaborating biobanks. In total, 240 fasting plasma samples were obtained from the LifeLines biobank. Samples had been stored for less than 2 or more than 4 years at -80°C. Measurements were performed at three different laboratories. hsCRP was measured by immunonephelometry and ELISA, hsIL6, and hsTNFα samples were measured with ELISAs from two different manufacturers. For confirmation, similar analyses were performed on samples obtained from a subpopulation of 80 obese individuals. Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the results. We observed good stability of samples stored at -80°C. hsCRP measured on the day of blood draw was similar to levels measured after more than 4 years of storage. There were small interlaboratory differences with the R&D ELISAs for hsIL6 and hsTNFα. We found a linear correlation between the Bender Medsystems ELISA and the R&D ELISA for hsIL6, with significantly higher levels measured with the R&D ELISA. Over 90% of hsTNFα samples measured with the IBL ELISA were below the detection limit of 0.13 ng/L, rendering this assay unsuitable for large-scale analysis. Similar results were found in the confirmation study. In summary, plasma hsCRP showed good stability in samples stored for either less than 2 years or more than 4 years at -80°C. Both the R&D and Bender Medsystems for hsIL6 measurement yielded similar results. The IBL hsTNFα assay is not suited for use in biobanking samples.

For this reason, phenome scans have to date tended to use a smaller homogeneous set of phenotypes that can be analysed in a consistent fashion. We present PHESANT (PHEnome Scan ANalysis Tool), a software package for performing comprehensive phenome scans in UK Biobank. PHESANT tests the association of a specified trait with all continuous, integer and categorical variables in UK Biobank, or a specified subset. PHESANT uses a novel rule-based algorithm to determine how to appropriately test each trait, then performs the analyses and produces plots and summary tables. The PHESANT phenome scan is implemented in R. PHESANT includes a novel Javascript D3.js visualization and accompanying Java code that converts the phenome scan results to the required JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. PHESANT is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT]. Git tag v0.5 corresponds to the version presented here.",,,

847,Patterns and correlates of active commuting in adults with type 2 diabetes: cross-sectional evidence from UK Biobank.,"Catherine L Falconer,Ashley R Cooper,Ellen Flint",,,,,2017,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28993386/," To describe the active commuting (AC) patterns of adults with type 2 diabetes and how these relate to physical activity and sedentary behaviour in UK Biobank. Social and environmental correlates of AC will also be explored. Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study. This is a population cohort of over 500 000 people recruited from 22 centres across the UK. Participants aged between 37 and 73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010. 6896 participants with a self-reported type 2 diabetes diagnosis who reported commuting to work and had complete covariate data were included in the analysis. Exposure measures were AC to work, measured as usual mode of transport. Outcome measures were weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), hours/day of sedentary time and participation in active travel. AC (reporting walking or cycling to work only) was reported by 5.5% of participants, with the great majority using the car to commute (80%). AC was associated with an additional 73 (95% CI 10.8 to 134.9) and 105 (95% CI 41.7 to 167.2) weekly minutes of MVPA for men and women, respectively. AC was associated with reduced sedentary time (β -1.1, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7 hours/day for men; and β -0.8, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.3 hours/day for women). Deprivation and distance from home to work were identified as correlates of AC behaviour. Rates of AC are very low in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, AC offers a potentially sustainable solution to increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. Therefore, strategies to improve the environment and encourage AC may help to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce the disease burden associated with type 2 diabetes.",,,"Adult;Aged;Automobile Driving;Bicycling;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Exercise;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Regression Analysis;Sedentary Behavior;Self Report;Time Factors;Transportation;United Kingdom;Walking;epidemiology;general Diabetes;preventive Medicine;public Health"

We describe a protocol and quality assurance process to enable carotid imaging at large scale that has been developed for the UK Biobank Imaging Enhancement Study of 100,000 individuals. Design An imaging protocol was developed to allow measurement of carotid intima-media thickness from the far wall of both common carotid arteries. Six quality assurance criteria were defined and a web-based interface (Intelligent Ultrasound) was developed to facilitate rapid assessment of images against each criterion. Results and conclusions Excellent inter and intra-observer agreements were obtained for image quality evaluations on a test dataset from 100 individuals. The image quality criteria then were applied in the UK Biobank Imaging Enhancement Study. Data from 2560 participants were evaluated. Feedback of results to the imaging team led to improvement in quality assurance, with quality assurance failures falling from 16.2% in the first two-month period examined to 6.4% in the last. Eighty per cent had all carotid intima-media thickness images graded as of acceptable quality, with at least one image acceptable for 98% of participants. Carotid intima-media thickness measures showed expected associations with increasing age and gender. Carotid imaging can be performed consistently, with semi-automated quality assurance of all scans, in a limited timeframe within a large scale multimodality imaging assessment.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimates for trail-making measures were 7.9% (part A), 22.4% (part B) and 17.6% (part B-part A). Significant genetic correlations were identified between trail-making measures and verbal-numerical reasoning (r>0.6), general cognitive function (r>0.6), processing speed (r>0.7) and memory (r>0.3). Polygenic profile analysis indicated considerable shared genetic aetiology between trail making, general cognitive function, processing speed and memory (standardized β between 0.03 and 0.08).

Preanalytical components of experiments, be they biospecimen acquisition, preparation, storage, or transportation to the laboratory, may all contribute to apparent variability in research data, outcomes, and interpretation. The present review article and biobanking innovation analysis offer new insights with a summary of such preanalytical variables, for example, the type of blood collection tube, centrifugation conditions, long-term sample storage temperature, and duration, on output of omics analyses of blood-derived biospecimens: whole blood, serum, plasma, buffy coat, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, we draw parallels from the field of precision medicine in this study, with a view to the future of  precision biobanking  wherein such preanalytical variations are carefully taken into consideration so as to minimize their influence on outcomes of omics data, analyses, and sensemaking, particularly in clinical omics applications.

Although fully-automated left ventricular (LV) analysis was performed in the original acquisition, this was not designed for unsupervised incorporation into epidemiological studies. We sought to evaluate automated LV mass and volume (Siemens syngo InlineVF versions D13A and E11C), against manual analysis in a substantial sub-cohort of UK Biobank participants. Eight readers from two centers, trained to give consistent results, manually analyzed 4874 UK Biobank cases for LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass (LVM). Agreement between manual and InlineVF automated analyses were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Tenfold cross-validation was used to establish a linear regression calibration between manual and InlineVF results. InlineVF D13A returned results in 4423 cases, whereas InlineVF E11C returned results in 4775 cases and also reported LVM. Rapid visual assessment of the E11C results found 178 cases (3.7%) with grossly misplaced contours or landmarks. In the remaining 4597 cases, LV function showed good agreement: ESV -6.4 ± 9.0 ml, 0.853 (mean ± SD of the differences, ICC) EDV -3.0 ± 11.6 ml, 0.937; SV 3.4 ± 9.8 ml, 0.855; and EF 3.5 ± 5.1%, 0.586. Although LV mass was consistently overestimated (29.9 ± 17.0 g, 0.534) due to larger epicardial contours on all slices, linear regression could be used to correct the bias and improve accuracy. Automated InlineVF results can be used for case-control studies in UK Biobank, provided visual quality control and linear bias correction are performed.

Nevertheless, only a minority of biobanks have policies regarding the distribution or destruction of tissue if the biobank were to close. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to report on the preferences of oncology biospecimen donors regarding the handling of their biospecimens in the event of biobank closure. A total of 98 biospecimen donors who were diagnosed with cancer at the Georgia Cancer Center for Excellence at Grady Memorial Hospital or the Winship Cancer Institute were interviewed concerning their preferences for the handling of their biospecimens in the event of biobank closure. The majority of biospecimen donors who expressed a preference (62 of 83 donors; 75%) wanted their biological materials transferred to another biobank, specifically an academic bank or a national bank. The most unacceptable options for the handling of tissue were transfer to a for-profit/pharmaceutical biobank (39 of 98 donors; 40%) or a biobank based outside of the United States (31 of 98 donors; 32%). Nonwhite participants were more likely to view the transfer of their tissue to a for-profit/pharmaceutical tissue bank, international tissue bank, or a national tissue bank as unacceptable compared with white participants. According to these biospecimen donors, the most acceptable options for the handling of biospecimens after biobank closure were transfer to an academic or national bank. The most objectionable options were transfer to a for-profit/pharmaceutical biobank or a biobank based outside of the United States. These findings can be used as the basis for educational interventions directed at the public and can inform the policies of biobanks that serve oncology research.

An ongoing Swedish case-control study on fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors and overweight in early childhood was used as the empirical example. Cases were defined as children with a body mass index (BMI) ⩾18 kg/m ( n=545) at four years of age, and controls as children with a BMI of ⩽17 kg/m ( n=4472 available). The risk of being overweight was modelled using logistic regression based on available covariates from the health examination and prior to selecting samples from the biobank. A risk score was estimated for each child and categorised as low (0-5%), medium (6-13%) or high (⩾14%) risk of being overweight. The final risk-score model, with smoking during pregnancy ( p=0.001), birth weight ( p<0.001), BMI of both parents ( p<0.001 for both), type of residence ( p=0.04) and economic situation ( p=0.12), yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 67% ( n=3945 with complete data). The case group ( n=416) had the following risk-score profile: low (12%), medium (46%) and high risk (43%). Twice as many controls were selected from each risk group, with further matching on sex.

The views of 21 ethics committee (EC) members and 22 researchers from Bengaluru, India, concerning the ethics of biobanking research were sought through in-depth interviews using an unfolding case vignette with probes. A shared view among most was that individual research results which are 'actionable' or have 'clinical significance' should be returned to the sample contributors through their treating physicians. This was seen as an ethical obligation and a moral duty on the side of the researcher to  give back  to the person who contributed to the research. The challenges foreseen were that of resources, both financial and personnel, for the time and counseling needed to accompany the disclosure of results. Perceptions of 'ownership' appear to influence the concept of benefit sharing. While benefit sharing in financial terms was considered ethically challenging, certain researchers and ethics committee members made a case for  two way altruism  where the researcher in return for the altruistic 'valuable contribution', shares with the contributor/ community, benefits of the research which could include research findings, improved patient care, and more affordable access to the new diagnostic tests or products arising from the research. This defines the emerging ethic of  giving back  which goes beyond individual rights and ensures reciprocity and distributive justice.",,,"Altruism;Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Committee Membership;Disclosure;Ethics Committees, Research;Ethics, Research;Humans;Incidental Findings;India;Medical Records;Moral Obligations;Ownership;Research Personnel;Research Subjects;Social Justice;Benefit sharing;Bio-medical researchers;Biobanking research;Distributive justice;Ethics Committees;Incidental findings;Research results"

Several biobanks have been created worldwide, which contribute to research and the better understanding of disease pathogenesis, genetical polymorphisms. Biobanking also helps to improve the efficacy of therapies. Our purpose was to create an internet-based biobank, in which laboratory test results, genetic alterations and related disorders of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients can be registered. This biobank would be able to make the research easier and it can help to improve our knowledge about diseases and it can inhibit loss of data. We have biological samples from 204 RA patients and we have entered their data in the biobank which can be found on the website http://rheuma.biobank.eu . Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS20 statistical programme. By the creation of biobank that contains clinical data and biological samples of 204 RA patients, we have a database which can help to improve our knowledge about the disease and help to develop new treatment strategies.

Our data integration framework aims at incorporating data about sample collections from different biobanks into a common research infrastructure, facilitating researchers' abilities to obtain high-quality samples to conduct their research. The resulting information must be locally gathered and distributed to searchable higher level information biobank directories to maximize the visibility on the national and European levels. Therefore, biobanks and sample collections must be clearly described and unambiguously identified. We describe how to tackle the challenges of integrating biobank-related data between biobank directories using heterogeneous data schemas and different technical environments. To establish a data exchange infrastructure between all biobank directories involved, we propose the following steps: (A) identification of core entities, terminology, and semantic relationships, (B) harmonization of heterogeneous data schemas of different Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI) directories, and (C) formulation of technical core principles for biobank data exchange between directories. (A) We identified the major core elements to describe biobanks in biobank directories. Since all directory data models were partially based on Minimum Information About BIobank Data Sharing (MIABIS) 2.0, the MIABIS 2.0 core model was used for compatibility. (B) Different projection scenarios were elaborated in collaboration with all BBMRI.at partners. A minimum set of mandatory and optional core entities and data items was defined for mapping across all directory levels. (C) Major core data exchange principles were formulated and data interfaces implemented by all biobank directories involved. We agreed on a MIABIS 2.0-based core set of harmonized biobank attributes and established a list of data exchange core principles for integrating biobank directories on different levels.

However, the long-term economic situation of biobanks is still mostly unclear. Also, the common sustainable utilization of various international biobanks is challenging due to local differences in sample processing, law and ethics. This article discusses possible strategies to achieve a sustainable utilization of biospecimens as part of the business plan of biobanks. The following questions were addressed as part of a business plan: (1) How can a biobank build up and maintain an up-to-date infrastructure? (2) What kind of funding can support the sustainability of a biobank? (3) Is there an international solution for informed consents to enable sample and data sharing? (4) How can a biobank react during economically unstable periods? (5) Which kind of biobanking research is innovative? (6) What kind of education could be most needful for knowledge transfer in biobanking? (7) Does an expiration date for a biobank make sense according to the period of funding? A strategy for optimal utilization begins with sharing of resources, infrastructure, and investments at the planning stage of a biobank, and continues to the transfer of knowledge and know-how by education.

875,A qualitative study of participants' views on re-consent in a longitudinal biobank.,"Mary Dixon-Woods,David Kocman,Liz Brewster,Janet Willars,Graeme Laurie,Carolyn Tarrant",,,,,2017,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28330487/," Biomedical research increasingly relies on long-term studies involving use and re-use of biological samples and data stored in large repositories or  biobanks  over lengthy periods, often raising questions about whether and when a re-consenting process should be activated. We sought to investigate the views on re-consent of participants in a longitudinal biobank. We conducted a qualitative study involving interviews with 24 people who were participating in a longitudinal biobank. Their views were elicited using a semi-structured interview schedule and scenarios based on a hypothetical biobank. Data analysis was based on the constant comparative method. What participants identified as requiring new consent was not a straightforward matter predictable by algorithms about the scope of the consent, but instead was contingent. They assessed whether proposed new research implied a fundamental alteration in the underlying character of the biobank and whether specific projects were within the scope of the original consent. What mattered most to them was that the cooperative bargain into which they had entered was maintained in good faith. They saw re-consent as one important safeguard in this bargain. In determining what required re-consent, they deployed two logics. First, they used a logic of boundaries, where they sought to detect any possible rupture with their existing framework of cooperation. Second, they used a logic of risk, where they assessed proposed research for any potential threats for them personally or the research endeavour. When they judged that a need for re-consent had been activated, participants saw the process as way of re-actualising and renewing the cooperative bargain. Participants' perceptions of research as a process of mutual co-operation between volunteer and researcher were fundamental to their views on consent. Consenting arrangements for biobanks should respect the cooperative values that are important to participants, recognise the two logics used by research volunteers, and avoid rigidity. Agility may be favoured by tiered consent combined with strong oversight mechanisms; this approach requires evaluation.",,,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cooperative Behavior;Data Collection;Ethics, Research;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Judgment;Logic;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Qualitative Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Research Subjects;Risk;Trust;Biomedical research;Human subjects research;Informed consent;Research ethics;Social science research"

The high-quality human biospecimens and associated data are required to better understand disease processes. Therefore, biobanks have become an important and essential resource for healthcare research and drug discovery. However, collecting and managing huge volumes of data (biospecimens and associated clinical data) necessitate that biobanks use appropriate data management solutions that can keep pace with the ever-changing requirements of research. To automate biobank data management, biobanks have been investing in traditional Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). However, there are a myriad of challenges faced by biobanks in acquiring traditional LIMS. Traditional LIMS are cost-intensive and often lack the flexibility to accommodate changes in data sources and workflows. Cloud technology is emerging as an alternative that provides the opportunity to small and medium-sized biobanks to automate their operations in a cost-effective manner, even without IT personnel. Cloud-based solutions offer the advantage of heightened security, rapid scalability, dynamic allocation of services, and can facilitate collaboration between different research groups by using a shared environment on a  pay-as-you-go  basis. The benefits offered by cloud technology have resulted in the development of cloud-based data management solutions as an alternative to traditional on-premise software. After evaluating the advantages offered by cloud technology, several biobanks have started adopting cloud-based tools. Cloud-based tools provide biobanks with easy access to biospecimen data for real-time sharing with clinicians. Another major benefit realized by biobanks by implementing cloud-based applications is unlimited data storage on the cloud and automatic backups for protecting any data loss in the face of natural calamities.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Cloud Computing;Database Management Systems;Humans;Information Management;Laboratories;Software;biobank;biospecimen;cloud-based tools;data management challenges;research;

We discuss ethical, social, and policy issues associated with returning results in the context of biobanks using a broad consent approach, in the light of data from a qualitative survey of citizens' and physicians' views. Data were collected through interviews and focus groups to investigate stakeholders' perspectives about a large-scale hospital-based biobank designed to foster biomedical research, including prospective genomics research, and  personalized  medicine. Both physicians and citizens considered psychosocial impacts as crucial in the assessment of benefits expected from a return of results to biobank participants. In particular, physicians highlighted the possible consequences on the patient-doctor relationship and discussed implications for the concept of  personalized  medicine. Citizens held ambivalent attitudes toward returning individual research results: they defended the  right not to know,  while they also considered a sort of  responsibility to know  because of potential implications of results for family members. Moreover, physicians and citizens raised questions about the broad consent model used for inhospital biobank recruitment and expressed their needs for more training in genomics and more information on the biobank initiative.

For this purpose, it is essential to establish sustainable systems to share clinical samples among researchers of academic institutes as well as commercial companies. So far, clinical biobanks have been considered an infrastructure that is advantageous or valuable for checking developing reagents, searching for companion biomarkers for diseases, cohort research, and constructing medical big data. However, easy-to-approach systems to access clinical samples between academia and commercial companies have yet to be established in Japan. The major reasons are ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI), the lack of simple procedures to evaluate stored samples, and the financial burden among participants. Additionally, the cultivation/training of human resources in related fields is also required. Needless to say, laboratory medicine is expected to play responsible roles in this field. Recently, next-generation DNA sequencers (NGS) have begun to be used in clinics, called clinical sequences, based on the samples of clinical biobanks. Clinical biobanks that preserve standardized and/or high-quality clinical samples are required. Further, to accomplish  precision medicine  or  individualized medicine , NGS/clinical sequence/genetic testing by high-quality DNA samples is required. The authors discussed the problem lists and ELSI to overcome these situations in order to establish commercially available clinical biobank networks in Japan.

The Saudi biobank, one of the newly established biobanks, has just started to collect data and samples in 2016. A survey was conducted to assess the opinions of stakeholders regarding the return of individual research results. A total of 180 adults from three different groups (researchers, physicians, and laypeople) participated in this cross-sectional study. There was strong agreement among all respondents that the biobank has the duty and donors have the right to be provided with important results that may have direct or indirect benefits. Moreover, there was strong support for the view that donors have the right to refuse to receive any research results. These results are compatible with many other studies and are in line with the governance of the Saudi biobank.",,,Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Male;Saudi Arabia;Tissue Donors;Saudi;biobank;return of results;

If a biobank has one such policy or plan, is it likely to have more? Using survey data from 456 U.S. biobanks, we assess four possible indicators of such  forward-thinking.  We present response frequencies and cross-tabulations regarding policies for return of results and ownership of specimens, and for having a formal business plan and a plan for what happens to specimens if the biobank closes. We analyze the relationships among these indicators, using chi-square for tests of statistical significance. Policies-Sixty-two percent of biobanks have a policy about returning individual research results; 70% have a policy designating ownership of specimens and/or technology. Having these two policies is significantly related (p < 0.001). Plans-34% of biobanks have a formal business plan; 26% have a written plan for what will happen to the specimens if the biobank closes. Having these two plans is significantly related (p < 0.001). Relationships among indicators-only 7% of biobanks are forward-thinking across all four indicators; 12% are forward-thinking across none. The two policies we examined tend to occur together, as do the two plans. These policies and plans seem to tap different aspects of accountability and responsiveness. Specifically, the policies reflect issues most commonly raised in the ethical and legal literature on biobanking, while the plans are indicators of sustainability, a separate area of concern in biobanking.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;United States;biobanks;business plan;ownership;policy;return of results;termination plan;
886,Whose Biobank? Should Biobanks Serve Research Interests or the Needs for Personalized Medicine? Analysis of the Hungarian Law.,"Judit Sándor",,,,,2017,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118032/," The law has struggled to justify the unilateral use of individual genomic data, as it could never quite fit either into the narrower data protection or the broader privacy frameworks. This article aims to explore this tension by examining rights and interests of biobank participants. This article offers a legal analysis, by looking at how the biobank model fits into a privacy rights framework. The Hungarian law is the primary focus of analysis, but reference is made to international legal norms, as well. The first biobanks were designed with the purpose of achieving collective goals by providing private data from the individual gene donors to scientific research and to the biotechnology industry. The main focus was on data protection. Today, more and more people, however, opt for an active biological citizenship: they want to have access to the results that are relevant to their health. The paternalistic legal attitude does not seem to fit this request to transfer data. In the long run, people should have the possibility to contact a biobank and to ask for the return of results. Practical barriers do not constitute a valid argument against the individual's need for disclosure. The law should be on people's side.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biotechnology;Humans;Hungary;access to genetic data;biobank;genetic testing and screening;legal policy;privacy;rights of the gene donors;

A wide range of phenotypic data has been collected at recruitment and has recently been enhanced by the UK Biobank Genotyping Project. All UK Biobank participants (500,000) have been genotyped on either the UK Biobank Axiom® Array or the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom® Array and the workflow for preparing samples for genotyping is described. The genetic data is hoped to provide further insight into the genetics of disease. All data, including the genetic data, is available for access to approved researchers. Data for two methods of DNA quantification (ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy [UV/Vis]) measured on the Trinean DropSense™ 96 and PicoGreen®) were compared by two laboratories (UK Biobank and Affymetrix). The sample processing workflow established at UK Biobank, for genotyping on the custom Affymetrix Axiom® array, resulted in high quality DNA (average DNA concentration 38.13 ng/μL, average 260/280 absorbance 1.91). The DNA generated high quality genotype data (average call rate 99.48% and pass rate 99.45%). The DNA concentration measured on the Trinean DropSense™ 96 at UK Biobank correlated well with DNA concentration measured by PicoGreen® at Affymetrix (r = 0.85). The UK Biobank Genotyping Project demonstrated that the high throughput DNA extraction protocol described generates high quality DNA suitable for genotyping on the Affymetrix Axiom array. The correlation between DNA concentration derived from UV/Vis and PicoGreen® quantification methods suggests, in large-scale genetic studies involving two laboratories, it may be possible to remove the DNA quantification step in one laboratory without affecting downstream analyses. This would result in reductions in cost and time to complete the project, allowing generation of genetic data faster and cheaper.",,,Algorithms;Biological Specimen Banks;DNA;Genotyping Techniques;Humans;Specimen Handling;United Kingdom;Affymetrix;DNA concentration;Genotyping;PicoGreen;Quantification;Trinean;UK Biobank;UV/Vis;
889,Becoming and being a biobank donor: The role of relationships and ethics.,"Signe Mezinska,Jekaterina Kaleja,Ilze Mileiko",,,,,2020,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33227030/,"Relational aspects, such as involvement of donor's relatives or friends in the decision-making on participation in a research biobank, providing relatives' health data to researchers, or sharing research findings with relatives should be considered when reflecting on ethical aspects of research biobanks. The aim of this paper is to explore what the role of donor's relatives and friends is in the process of becoming and being a biobank donor and which ethical issues arise in this context. We performed qualitative analysis of 40 qualitative semi-structured interviews with biobank donors and researchers. The results show that relatedness to relatives or other types of close relationships played a significant role in the donors' motivation to be involved in a biobank, risk-benefit assessment, and decisions on sharing information on research and its results. Interviewees mentioned ethical issues in the context of sharing relatives' health-related data for research purposes and returning research findings that may affect their relatives. We conclude that the question of what information on family members may be shared with a biobank by research participants without informed consent of those relatives, and when family members become research subjects, lacks a clear answer and detailed guidelines, especially in the context of the introduction of the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation. Researchers in Latvia and EU face ethical questions and dilemmas about returning research results and incidental findings to donors' relatives, and donors need more information on sharing research results with relatives in the informed consent process.",,,Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Clinical Decision-Making;Family;Female;Friends;Humans;Latvia;Male;Middle Aged;Motivation;Research Personnel;Tissue Donors;

Previous work investigated the associations between genetically predicted telomere length and cancers; however, the types of cancers investigated in those studies were relatively limited or the telomere length-associated genetic variants employed often came from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with small sample sizes. We constructed the genetic risk score (GRS) for leukocyte telomere length based on 17 associated genetic variants available from the largest telomere length GWAS up to 78,592 individuals. Then, a comprehensive analysis was undertaken to evaluate the association between the constructed GRS and the risk or mortality of a wide range of cancers [i.e., 37 cancers in the UK Biobank and 33 cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)]. We further applied the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effect of leukocyte telomere length on UK Biobank cancers via summary statistics. In the UK Biobank dataset, we found that the GRS of leukocyte telomere length was associated with a decreased risk of nine types of cancer (i.e., significant association with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, kidney/renal cell cancer, bladder cancer, malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer and suggestive association with sarcoma/fibrosarcoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma/Hodgkin's disease). In addition, we found that the GRS was suggestively associated with an increased risk of leukemia. In the TCGA dataset, we observed suggestive evidence that the GRS was associated with a high death hazard of rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), while the GRS was associated with a low death hazard of kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). The results of MR further supported the association for leukocyte telomere length on the risk of malignant melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma/Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Our study reveals that telomere played diverse roles in different types of cancers. However, further validations in large-scale prospective studies and deeper investigations of the biologic mechanisms are warranted.",,,Mendelian randomization;TCGA;UK Biobank;cancer;genetic risk score;leukocyte telomere length;

Notifying contributors at the time of sample distribution provides one form of communication to supplement broad consent. However, little is known about how community-informed governance might anticipate contributor responses and inform communication efforts. We explored the attitudes of members of a three-site Community Advisory Board (CAB) network. CAB members responded to a hypothetical proposal for notifying biobank contributors at the time of sample distribution to researchers utilizing the biobank. We used regularly scheduled CAB meetings to facilitate 3 large-group and 6 small-group discussions. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for thematic content using descriptive thematic analysis. The results challenged our expectation of general support for the proposed communications. While CAB members identified some advantages, they were concerned about several potential harms to biobank contributors and the biobank. The CABs understood biobank communication in terms of an ongoing relationship with the biobank and a personal contribution to research. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on community engagement in biobanking. Additional communication with biobank contributors can serve a variety of value-based objectives to supplement broad consent. Design of communication efforts by biobanks can be improved by CAB members' anticipation of the unintended consequences of additional contact with contributors. CAB members' holistic interpretation of communication efforts suggests that biobank leadership considers all communication options as part of a more comprehensive communications strategy.",,,"Access to Information;Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Communication;Ethics, Research;Governing Board;Humans;Informed Consent;Patient Rights;Biobank ethics;Biorepository;Broad consent;Communication;Community advisory board;Governance;Research ethics"

Despite the non-standard nature of these tests and the limited psychometric information, the UK Biobank cognitive data have been used in numerous scientific publications. The present study examined the validity and short-term test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank cognitive tests. A sample of 160 participants (mean age = 62.59, SD = 10.24) was recruited who completed the UK Biobank cognitive assessment and a range of well-validated cognitive tests ('reference tests'). Fifty-two participants returned 4 weeks later to repeat the UK Biobank tests. Correlations were calculated between UK Biobank tests and reference tests. Two measures of general cognitive ability were created by entering scores on the UK Biobank cognitive tests, and scores on the reference tests, respectively, into separate principal component analyses and saving scores on the first principal component. Four-week test-retest correlations were calculated for UK Biobank tests. UK Biobank cognitive tests showed a range of correlations with their respective reference tests, i.e. those tests that are thought to assess the same underlying cognitive ability (mean Pearson r = 0.53, range = 0.22 to 0.83, p≤.005). The measure of general cognitive ability based on the UK Biobank cognitive tests correlated at r = 0.83 (p < .001) with a measure of general cognitive ability created using the reference tests.

This together with their stability while freely circulating in blood suggests that they could serve as minimal-invasive biomarkers for a wide range of diseases. Successful miRNA-based biomarker discovery in plasma is dependent on controlling sources of preanalytical variation, such as cellular contamination and hemolysis, as they can be major causes of altered miRNA expression levels. Analysis of plasma quality is therefore a crucial step for the best output when searching for novel miRNA biomarkers. Plasma quality was assessed by three different methods in samples from mother-child duos (maternal and cord blood, N = 2x38), with collection and storage methods comparable to large cohort study biobanks. Total RNA was isolated and the expression profiles of 201 miRNAs was obtained by qPCR to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in cord and maternal plasma samples. All three methods for quality assurance indicate that the plasma samples used in this study are of high quality with very low levels of contamination, suitable for analysis of circulating miRNAs. We identified 19 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between cord and maternal plasma samples (paired t-tests, FDR<0.05, and fold change>±1.5), and we observed low correlation of miRNA transcript levels between cord and maternal samples throughout our dataset. Our findings suggest that good quality plasma samples suitable for miRNA profiling can be achieved from samples collected and stored by large biobanks. Incorporation of extensive quality control measures, such as those established here, would be beneficial for future projects. The overall low correlation of miRNA expression between cord and maternal samples is an interesting observation, and promising for our future studies on identification of miRNA-based biomarkers in cord blood plasma, considering that these samples were collected at term and some exchange of blood components between cord and maternal blood frequently occur.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Child;Child Health;Circulating MicroRNA;Cohort Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Mothers;Pilot Projects;Plasma;

Cohorts with biological material are necessary to investigate potential biological mechanisms behind a disease and its early detection. Establishing a biobank is expensive and the long-term sustainability of biorepositories is a key issue globally. There is some published information on tools to calculate the biospecimen user fee; however, they may not be suitable for China's biobanks (as most of the biobanks in China are not for profit and are funded by government or research grants, and as such, funding is a major constraint). The limited published data also tend to be highly variable and specific to the type of biobank. The authors of this article aim to present the basis of a cost analysis model for a biobank of human biological samples of a birth cohort in Shanghai, China. The results show that it is very practical for us to consider how to build a cost model for the birth cohort biobank from the direct funds, such as storage equipment, temperature monitoring system, information management system, and so on. We conclude that by comparing the similarities and differences between China's cost model and that of other countries, this paper provides valuable information for biobankers to identify new perspectives on potential collaborators and mutual learning opportunities.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;China;Costs and Cost Analysis;Financial Management;Humans;biological specimen bank;budget;cohort study;cost analysis;sustainability;

These exploitative practices must be guarded against, but the current regulation of genomic research in Africa adopts a precautionary approach that at times is restrictive in nature. We argue that the regulation and oversight of genomic biobank research should guard against exploitative research, but in a manner that promotes reciprocal benefit and not restrictive research practices.

There is recognition that sarcopenia may occur at younger ages in those with long-term conditions (LTCs) as well as those with multimorbidity (the presence of two or more LTCs), but their relationships have been little explored. Our aims were to describe the prevalence of sarcopenia in UK Biobank, a large sample of men and women aged 40-70 years, and to explore relationships with different categories of LTCs and multimorbidity. We used data from 499 046 participants in the baseline of UK Biobank. Our main outcome was probable sarcopenia based on maximum grip strength below sex-specific cut-points. Participants' LTCs were recorded during an interview and categorized against a hierarchy. We used logistic regression to examine the independent associations between each category of LTCs and probable sarcopenia, including adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index. We also examined the association with multimorbidity. Probable sarcopenia had an overall prevalence of 5.3% and increased with age. The categories with the strongest associations with probable sarcopenia were musculoskeletal/trauma [OR 2.17 (95% CI: 2.11, 2.23)], endocrine/diabetes [OR 1.49 (95% CI: 1.45, 1.55)], and neurological/psychiatric [OR 1.39 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.43)] LTCs. Almost half of the sample (44.5%) had multimorbidity, and they were at nearly twice the odds of probable sarcopenia [OR 1.96 (95% CI: 1.91, 2.02)] compared with those without. We have shown an overall prevalence of 5.3% of probable sarcopenia at ages 40-70 in UK Biobank. The risk of probable sarcopenia was higher in those with some categories of LTCs, suggesting that these groups may stand to benefit from assessment of sarcopenia, during mid-life as well as old age.",,,Adult;Aged;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Multimorbidity;Sarcopenia;Survival Analysis;United Kingdom;Grip strength;Later life;Long-term conditions;Mid-life;Multimorbidity;Sarcopenia;

Multinomial regression extends logistic regression to multiple categories. However, many phenotypes more naturally take ordered, discrete values. Examples include (a) subtypes defined from multiple sources of clinical information and (b) derived phenotypes generated by specific phenotyping algorithms for electronic health records (EHR). GWAS of ordinal traits have been problematic. Dichotomizing can lead to a range of arbitrary cutoff values, generating inconsistent, hard to interpret results. Using multinomial regression ignores trait value hierarchy and potentially loses power. Treating ordinal data as quantitative can lead to misleading inference. To address these issues, we analyze ordinal traits with an ordered, multinomial model. This approach increases power and leads to more interpretable results. We derive efficient algorithms for computing test statistics, making ordinal trait GWAS computationally practical for Biobank scale data. Our method is available as a Julia package OrdinalGWAS.jl. Application to a COPDGene study confirms previously found signals based on binary case-control status, but with more significance. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of our package to run on UK Biobank data by analyzing hypertension as an ordinal trait.",,,"Algorithms;Biological Specimen Banks;Case-Control Studies;Computer Simulation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Hypertension;Models, Genetic;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive;Regression Analysis;Respiratory Function Tests;electronic health record;genome-wide association study;ordered multinomial regression"

GBN, in cooperation with designated members of GBA, has developed various services and products for the German biobank community. To ensure that services and products are well aligned with the needs and interests of relevant stakeholders, GBN actively engages with its diverse stakeholder groups through different methods. Important stakeholder groups are the members of GBA who are generally the first users of developed products and services.  Members of GBA were surveyed anonymously through a web-based application. The survey was sent to all members registered with an internal communication platform. Participants were primarily asked about their experiences with GBN, developed products and services, their wishes for the future of GBN/GBA, and their attitudes toward intensified cooperation on the European level. Answers were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.  Overall 63 of 110 registered GBA members (response rate of 57%) finished the survey. Participants were overall satisfied with the work of GBN and developed products and services. They also pointed out room for improvement. Participants, for example, proposed to shorten the survey developed for biobanks to engage with their users. They also shared what additional support wishes they had, for example, uniform cost models or use and access policies for the GBA community.  The survey was helpful to get a good overview of the experiences and attitudes of GBA members before making services and products available to other actors in the German biobank community. GBN will use the feedback to improve its work and to guide future strategy development.

With improvements in administrative and informatics infrastructure, the availability and utility of data from biobanks have dramatically increased. In this paper, we first aim to characterize the current landscape of available biobanks and to describe specific biobanks, including their place of origin, size, and data types. The development and accessibility of large-scale biorepositories provide the opportunity to accelerate agnostic searches, expedite discoveries, and conduct hypothesis-generating studies of disease-treatment, disease-exposure, and disease-gene associations. Rather than designing and implementing a single study focused on a few targeted hypotheses, researchers can potentially use biobanks' existing resources to answer an expanded selection of exploratory questions as quickly as they can analyze them. However, there are many obvious and subtle challenges with the design and analysis of biobank-based studies. Our second aim is to discuss statistical issues related to biobank research such as study design, sampling strategy, phenotype identification, and missing data. We focus our discussion on biobanks that are linked to electronic health records. Some of the analytic issues are illustrated using data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative and UK Biobank, two biobanks with two different recruitment mechanisms. We summarize the current body of literature for addressing these challenges and discuss some standing open problems.

We examined the association between environmental exposures (PM, greenness, and urbanicity) and COPD prevalence using the UK Biobank cohort data to identify key built environment correlates of COPD. In this cross-sectional, observational study we used baseline data for UK Biobank participants. Included participants were aged 39 years and older, white, had available spirometry data, and had complete data for phenotypes and exposures. COPD was defined by spirometry with the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Environmental exposures were PM derived from monitoring data and interpolated using land-use regression at the participants' geocoded residential addresses. Built environment metrics of residential greenness were modelled in terms of normalised difference vegetation index from remotely sensed colour infrared data within a 500 m residential catchment, and an urbanicity index derived from spatial analyses and measured with a 1 km buffer around each participant's residential address. Logistic regression models examined the associations between environmental exposures and COPD prevalence adjusting for a range of confounders. Subgroup analyses by urbanicity and effect modification by white blood cell count as an inflammatory marker were also done. We assessed 96 779 participants recruited between April 4, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, of which 5391 participants had COPD with a prevalence of 5·6%. Each 10 μg/m increment in ambient PM exposure at a participant's residential location was associated with higher odds of COPD (odds ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·14-2·10). Among the built environment metrics, urbanicity was associated with higher odds of COPD (1·05, 1·01-1·08 per interquartile increment), whereas residential greenness was protective, being associated with lower odds of COPD (0·89, 0·84-0·93 for each interquartile increment in greenness). The results remained consistent in models of COPD defined as per lower limit of normal criteria. The highest quartile of white blood cell count was associated with lower lung function and higher COPD risk with a significant interaction between PM and white blood cell count only in the model of lung function (p=0·0003). In this study of the built environment and COPD, to our knowledge the largest done in the UK, we found that exposure to ambient PM and urbanicity were associated with a higher risk of COPD. Residing in greener areas, as measured by normalised difference vegetation index, was associated with lower odds of COPD, suggesting the potential value of urban planning and design in minimising or offsetting environmental risks for the prevention and management of COPD.

Here, we describe efforts to validate previous metabolomic findings using a historical cohort of breast cancer patients and discuss challenges with using older biobanks collected with non-standardized sampling procedures.  In total, 100 primary breast cancer samples were analysed by high-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR MAS MRS) and subsequently examined by histology. Metabolomic profiles were related to the presence of cancer tissue, hormone receptor status, T-stage, N-stage, and survival. RNA integrity number (RIN) and metabolomic profiles were compared with an ongoing breast cancer biobank.  The 100 samples had a median RIN of 4.3, while the ongoing biobank had a significantly higher median RIN of 6.3 ( = 5.86 × 10). A low RIN was associated with changes in choline-containing metabolites and creatine, and the samples in the older biobank showed metabolic differences previously associated with tissue degradation. The association between metabolomic profile and oestrogen receptor status was in accordance with previous findings, however, with a lower classification accuracy.

The main corpus of biobank samples, however, consists of approximately 10 million  legacy samples . These are old diagnostic or research samples that were transferred to biobanks in accordance with the Biobank Act. The focus of this article is on ambiguities concerning these legacy samples and their transfer in terms of legality, human rights, autonomy, and social sustainability. We analyse the Finnish biobank operations in the context of international regulation, such as the European Convention of Human Rights, the Oviedo Convention, European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the GDPR, and EU Clinical Trials Regulation, and show that the practice of using legacy samples is at times problematic in relation to this regulatory framework. We argue that the prevailing interpretations of these regulations as translated into the Finnish biobank practices undermine the autonomy of individuals by not giving individuals a right to consent or an actionable right to opt-out of the transfer of these legacy samples to the biobank. This is due to the fact that individuals are not given effective notification of such transfers. Thus, issues regarding the legal status of the biobank samples and the social sustainability of biobank operations remain a challenge for biobanks in Finland despite governmental efforts to create pioneering, comprehensive, and enabling legislation.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Finland;Humans;Prospective Studies;Specimen Handling;

Besides broad consent these models include tiered, dynamic, and meta-consent. However, critics have pointed out that it is normally not known at the time of enrolment in what ways samples deposited in a biobank may be used in future research and that, for a consent to be informed, exactly this kind of knowledge is required. Therefore, there is an ongoing debate about the ethical acceptability of going for less than study-specific consent. In light of this debate we address the question of how to best protect participants against relevant risks and violations of autonomy. We apply the central aims of the informed consent process to the unique circumstances of biobank research where samples and data in many cases are stored for long periods of time and reused in subsequent studies. Thereby we are able to formulate a set of criteria focusing both on the risk of informational harm and the potential violation of participants' values. We compare existing models of consent based on their ability to satisfy the criteria, and we find that the broad consent model offers the best level of protection for participants, although, it suffers from a few important deficiencies with regards to protection against participant value violations and long-term protection of autonomy, if it is applied without qualifications. For this reason, we propose modifications to the current broad consent model, in order to ensure that it provides protection of autonomy and participant values through strong ethical review and continuous communication. We conclude that a modified form of broad consent is ethically superior in biobank research, not only because it is most feasible but primarily because it offers the best available protection against the hazards facing research subjects in this form of research.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Informed Consent;Personal Autonomy;Autonomy;Biobank research;Consent models;Ethics;Informed consent;Risks;

Ubuntu, as a component of responsive communitarianism where communal welfare is valued together with individual autonomy, is useful in furthering our understanding of effective CE and how it could best be achieved. Similarly, a relative solidarity model serves as a compromise between extreme individualism and extreme communalism and is more appropriate in a heterogenous African context. Approaching CE from an Ubuntu philosophical perspective in southern Africa is particularly important in genomic biobanking, given the implications for individuals, families, and communities.  CE is often implemented in a tokenistic manner as an ancillary component of research. Understanding consent information is challenging where genomic biobanking is concerned due to scientific complexity. We started a process of CE around genomic biobanking and conducted empirical research in an attempt to develop a model to promote effective and ethically sound CE, using relative solidarity to create a nuanced application of Ubuntu. The TRUCE model is an eight-step model that uses social mapping to identify potential communities, establishes the scope of CE, and requires that communities are approached early. Co-creation strategies for CE are encouraged and co-ownership of knowledge production is emphasized. Recruiting and engaging communities at each stage of research is necessary. Evaluation and adaptation of CE strategies are included. Discussion and dissemination of results after the research is completed are encouraged.  There is a significant gap between the theory of CE and its authentic application to research in Africa. This Ubuntu-inspired model facilitates bridging that gap and is particularly suited to genomic biobanking. The CE model enhances and complements the consent process and should be integrated into research as a funding and regulatory requirement where applicable.",,,Africa;Biological Specimen Banks;Community Participation;Community-Based Participatory Research;Empirical Research;Genomics;Humans;biobank;community engagement;consent;genomic;

Outcomes for patients with these disorders vary considerably, likely due to the added influence of a range of interacting clinical, metabolic, environmental, lifestyle, genetic and psychosocial risk factors associated with these diseases. The Baker Biobank study was designed to characterise these factors to inform better risk prediction, earlier diagnosis and better treatment of CVDs and diabetes. This paper describes the detailed methods for the establishment of the Baker Biobank. The study collected extensive phenotypic detail about the participants recruited from Victoria, Australia. Data and samples were collected at the Departments of Cardiology and Respiratory Medicine at the Alfred Hospital and Healthy Hearts Program at the Baker Institute. A total of 6,530 adults with age 18-69 years were recruited into the Biobank. The majority of these participants (63%) were male. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the Biobank Cohort at the time of data collection was 57(15) years. The study collected data on socio-demographic characteristics, behavioural and lifestyle factors, anthropometric measurements, medical and medication history, and blood levels of various biomarkers. The study also collected and stored Guthrie cards, serum, plasma, buffy coat, whole blood collected in Tempus tubes (for RNA extraction). For some samples extracted DNA and RNA is stored. The Biobank data is also linked to echocardiogram, hospital admission, pathology and mortality datasets.

The Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC) aims to facilitate access to such biological resources. The accompanying ADOPT BBMRI-ERIC project kick-started BBMRI-ERIC by collecting colorectal cancer data from European biobanks. To transform these data into a common representation, a uniform approach for data integration and harmonization had to be developed. This article describes the design and the implementation of a toolset for this task. Based on the semantics of a metadata repository, we developed a lexical bag-of-words matcher, capable of semiautomatically mapping local biobank terms to the central ADOPT BBMRI-ERIC terminology. Its algorithm supports fuzzy matching, utilization of synonyms, and sentiment tagging. To process the anonymized instance data based on these mappings, we also developed a data transformation application. The implementation was used to process the data from 10 European biobanks. The lexical matcher automatically and correctly mapped 78.48% of the 1,492 local biobank terms, and human experts were able to complete the remaining mappings. We used the expert-curated mappings to successfully process 147,608 data records from 3,415 patients. A generic harmonization approach was created and successfully used for cross-institutional data harmonization across 10 European biobanks. The software tools were made available as open source.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Colorectal Neoplasms;Europe;Humans;Reference Standards;

From August 2014 to August 2016, patients with elevated levels of PSA and at least 1 suspicious lesion on MRI were invited to this study. Each MRI-suspicious lesion was biopsied repeatedly for at least 2 cores in the same location. These repeated cores were labelled A/A', B/B', etc. The A/B cores were submitted for histologic assessment, and the corresponding A'/B' cores were stored in an -80°C freezer for biobanking. Sixty biobanked samples were processed for histologic assessment to compare their pathologic parameters with their corresponding paraffin samples. Another 20 biobanked samples were processed for RNA quality evaluation. Fifty-six of the 60 selected banking samples matched their corresponding paraffin samples for benign vs malignant diagnosis, leading an overall concordance rate of 93.3%. There was no significant difference between banking samples and the corresponding paraffin samples in cancer percentage and Gleason score. The RNA Integrity Number value ranged from 6.8 to 9.3 (mean 7.89). The current study demonstrates that the histologic identity of the banked prostate biopsy sample can be accurately predicted by its corresponding paraffin samples.

We designed a structured survey to be administered to patients coming to the outpatient clinics in 3 university hospitals in Egypt. The survey included questions estimating the level of knowledge about the term  Biobank , together with questions about the attitudes and opinions about related issues. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients participated in the survey. Eighty-one percent of participants reported that they never heard about the term before. About 85% expressed that they would be willing to donate their samples for research and about 87% thought that sample donation did not contradict their religious beliefs. Fifty eight percent were willing to participate in a genetic research project, 27.8% supported sharing their sample with pharmaceutical companies, and 32.4% agreed to share their samples with institutions abroad. Although there is limited knowledge about biobanking among Egyptian patients, many had a positive attitude towards sample donation and didn't show religious concerns against it.

We examined the relation using a Mendelian randomization design in a large Biobank, the UK Biobank. We identified 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly and independently related to HbA1c from a large genome wide association study (n = 123 665) and applied them to the UK Biobank (n = 376 644). We used inverse variance weighting (IVW) to assess the relation of HbA1c with risk of hypertension (defined using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 guidelines), and SBP and DBP. Sensitivity analyses included Mendelian randomization-Egger, weighted median, Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier and exclusion of pleiotropic SNPs. HbA1c was not clearly associated with hypertension risk using IVW (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.62) in the main analysis. However, Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier suggested potential horizontal pleiotropy. After excluding potentially invalid SNPs, HbA1c was associated with hypertension risk (IVW odds ratio 1.22 per %, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.46), with consistent estimates from sensitivity analyses. HbA1c was positively associated with SBP in some, but not all analyses, albeit with directionally consistent estimates. The relation with DBP was unclear. Our study suggests HbA1c may increase hypertension risk and could be one underlying mechanistic pathway between HbA1c and coronary artery disease risk.",,,Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Glycated Hemoglobin;Humans;Hypertension;Mendelian Randomization Analysis;Risk Factors;United Kingdom;

Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of genetic architecture, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by allele frequency and/or LD. We show analytically and through extensive simulations starting from real genotypes (UK Biobank, N = 337 K) that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator is robust across a wide range of architectures.

This focus on quality is currently centered mostly on intrinsic features of biospecimens and their annotating data. This review highlights additional quality features that are important to researchers in determining the fit for purpose in their research. First, we define complex qualities as those that are mostly extrinsic to the individual biospecimen and data, and second, we provide data on the growth in demand for biospecimens with this type of quality in cancer research biobanks.

Awareness of their value has increased along with the need for these infrastructures to be sustained through business-focused practices. Following our 2017 pilot survey on biobank business planning, we initiated a more comprehensive 38-question multiple-language worldwide survey on biobank sustainability. Two hundred seventy-six biobanks of various sizes and stages of business planning (in place, in progress or none) responded. About two-thirds were established in the last 10 years. Survey results confirm our hypothesis that biobanks with business plans or preparing such plans are trending toward more professional structures. Specific survey data focusing on performance metrics and utilization, as related to sustainability, are presented. Biobanks most frequently measured basic performance metrics (sample utilization, samples collected, samples distributed, internal projects supported). Metrics less often reported included sample and data quality, cost recovery, citations, and publications, typically correlating with higher levels of biobank complexity and professionalism. Biobanks reported supporting projects for both internal and external use, with support of projects within their own organizations as the main driver of biobanks, independent of business plan status. Having a business plan seemed to be a key factor for biobanks that had developed sustained support for external commercial projects. While under half of the biobanks reported both target and actual utilization rates, the responses provided valuable data on utilization. Target utilization rates were much higher (2.5 to 5 times higher) than the rate of actual use. Many of the biobanks report less than 10% utilization. Biobanks with low utilization rates make sustainability a very distant and likely unreachable goal. Our survey has provided some basic data about biobank business planning globally.

938,Questioning the rhetoric of a 'willing population' in Finnish biobanking.,"Karoliina Snell,Heta Tarkkala",,,,,2019,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31131432/,"According to surveys and opinion polls, citizens in Nordic welfare societies have positive, supportive attitudes towards medical research and biobanking. In Finland, it was expected that this would result in the active biobank participation of patients and citizens. Indeed, public support has been rhetorically utilised as a unique societal factor and advantage in the promotion of Finnish biobanks, underlining the potential Finland offers for the international biomedical enterprise. In this paper, we critically analyse the use of notions such as 'willing population' and 'engaged people' in the promotion and legitimation of biobanking. First, there is a seeming contradiction between positive attitudes and actual participation rates, as biobanks have faced unexpected challenges in participant recruitment during the first years of their operations. As a result, the concept of a willing population was redirected to problematise the necessity of informed consent. Second, we question whether it is even meaningful to assume the existence of an informed and engaged population with regard to biobanking. Therefore, we suggest that it is problematic to talk about a willing population at the same time as the relevance of the informed consent system is being questioned by biobank actors and policy makers. We analyse this tension in relation to existing data on Finnish people's attitudes, pointing out that positive, supportive views do not directly transform into high participation rates; nor do they justify the claims of policy makers and biobank proponents that people are willing to participate, when in fact surveys report that people know very little about biobanks.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Finland;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Humans;Biobanks;Finland;Informed consent;Innovation policy;Participation;Public opinion"

To facilitate this development, there is a significant growth of biobanks in the country to ensure continuous collection of biological samples for future research, which contain extremely important personal information and health data of the participants involved. Given the vast amount of samples and data accumulated by biobanks, they can be considered as reservoirs of precious biomedical big data. It is therefore imperative for biobanks to have in place regulatory measures to ensure ethical use of the biomedical big data. Malaysia has yet to introduce specific legislation for the field of biobanking. However, it can be argued that its existing Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) has laid down legal principles that can be enforced to protect biomedical big data generated by the biobanks. Consent is a mechanism to enable data subjects to exercise their autonomy by determining how their data can be used and ensure compliance with legal principles. However, there are two main concerns surrounding the current practice of consent in biomedical big data in Malaysia. First, it is uncertain that the current practice would be able to respect the underlying notion of autonomy, and second, it is not in accordance with the legal principles of the PDPA. Scholars have deliberated on different strategies of informed consent, and a more interactive approach has recently been introduced: dynamic consent. It is argued that a dynamic consent approach would be able to address these concerns.",,,Autonomy;Biobanking;Data protection;Dynamic consent;Informed consent;

The agency conducts research on cancer with worldwide collaborations, adopting a multidisciplinary approach of epidemiology and laboratory-based studies on cancer causes, as well as preventive interventions. The IARC Biobank stores multiple collections of samples and conducts preanalytical services for studies conducted worldwide in support of the research activities. Traditionally, the multiple collections from these studies were managed by the individual research groups in different project-specific databases. In 2010, a program to centralize sample collections into a single platform was initiated by adopting a common database with the introduction of a minimum dataset for sample collections received at IARC. The process involved checking data files, verifying the storage location of samples, conducting data harmonization, and importing or migrating existing data from project-specific spreadsheets and databases into the common database. In addition to the creation of a common biobank database and an up-to-date inventory of IARC's biological resources, a governance structure was established. The creation of the Biobank Steering Committee and the adoption of an access policy is to facilitate and guide the sharing of IARC's resources in a transparent manner, while taking into account Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Cryopreservation;Humans;Information Dissemination;Neoplasms;Specimen Handling;biobank;centralization;database;dataset;governance;harmonization;

POPIA will have an impact on health research, including biobanks. As sharing of samples and data is a central feature of biobanks, POPIA could change the way in which data are obtained, shared and exported. In particular, the provisions regarding data minimisation, requirements pertaining to the transfer of data abroad, consent provisions and identification of the 'responsible person' will impact the operation of biobanks in SA.

Subsequently, we presented them with data from another study showing that many U.S. adults would fail to comprehend the information the panel had deemed essential. When asked to evaluate the importance of the information again, panelists' opinions shifted dramatically in the direction of requiring that less information be understood. Follow-up interviews indicated significant uncertainty about defining a threshold of understanding and what should happen when prospective participants are unable to grasp key information.

Newer molecular platforms can accelerate biomarker discovery, but they require significant resources for data and sample acquisition. The purpose of this study was to test a pragmatic biomarker discovery strategy integrating automated clinical biobanking with proteomics. Using the electronic health record, the authors identified patients with and without HF, retrieved their discarded plasma samples, and screened these specimens using a DNA aptamer-based proteomic platform (1,129 proteins). Candidate biomarkers were validated in 3 different prospective cohorts. In an automated manner, plasma samples from 1,315 patients (31% with HF) were collected. Proteomic analysis of a 96-patient subset identified 9 candidate biomarkers (p < 4.42 × 10). Two proteins, angiopoietin-2 and thrombospondin-2, were associated with HF in 3 separate validation cohorts. In an emergency department-based registry of 852 dyspneic patients, the 2 biomarkers improved discrimination of acute HF compared with a clinical score (p < 0.0001) or clinical score plus B-type natriuretic peptide (p = 0.02). In a community-based cohort (n = 768), both biomarkers predicted incident HF independent of traditional risk factors and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio per SD increment: 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 1.61; p = 0.0007] for angiopoietin-2, and 1.37 [95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.79; p = 0.02] for thrombospondin-2). Among 30 advanced HF patients, concentrations of both biomarkers declined (80% to 84%) following cardiac transplant (p < 0.001 for both). A novel strategy integrating electronic health records, discarded clinical specimens, and proteomics identified 2 biomarkers that robustly predict HF across diverse clinical settings.

However, current regulations do not require such planning, so it is unclear if and how biobanks have prepared themselves to deal with future crises. This exploratory study used mixed methods to understand the state of continuity planning in U.S. biobanks. It first reviewed the current state of regulatory and implementation requirements that drive and challenge continuity planning. A survey instrument was then developed and critiqued by a focus group of experienced practitioners in biobanking. The refined survey was disseminated to a targeted group of respondents employed at biobanks across the United States. Most respondents were associated with relatively mature biobanks in operation for more than 6 years and these typically had some form of continuity plan in place. More commonly, continuity planning was reported to be focused on countering natural disasters rather than organization- or personnel-related crises. Respondents identified their most common limitation to be financial resources affecting all phases of implementation. Although many respondents appeared to be aware of some guidance documents and standards for continuity planning, many reported that they did not use or reference them when constructing their biobank continuity plans. Furthermore, nearly 25% of surveyed biobanks did not have a continuity plan and 61% indicated concern in having a mandated continuity plan. Results suggested academic organizations would benefit from a continuity plan template and best practice guidelines for plan development and implementation.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Disaster Planning;Economics;Focus Groups;Guidelines as Topic;Humans;United States;best practice;biobank;disaster;implementation;vulnerability;

Linear mendelian randomisation analyses indicated an overall positive association between genetically predicted BMI and the risk of all cause mortality. An increase of 1 unit in genetically predicted BMI led to a 5% (95% confidence interval 1% to 8%) higher risk of mortality in overweight participants (BMI 25.0-29.9) and a 9% (4% to 14%) higher risk of mortality in obese participants (BMI ≥30.0) but a 34% (16% to 48%) lower risk in underweight (BMI <18.5) and a 14% (-1% to 27%) lower risk in low normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-19.9). Non-linear mendelian randomisation indicated a J shaped relation between genetically predicted BMI and the risk of all cause mortality, with the lowest risk at a BMI of around 22-25 for the overall sample. Subgroup analyses by smoking status, however, suggested an always-increasing relation of BMI with mortality in never smokers and a J shaped relation in ever smokers. The previously observed J shaped relation between BMI and risk of all cause mortality appears to have a causal basis, but subgroup analyses by smoking status revealed that the BMI-mortality relation is likely comprised of at least two distinct curves, rather than one J shaped relation.

A limitation of this approach is that it may not be possible to discuss or anticipate all potential uses of biospecimens at the time patient consent is obtained. We surveyed biobank participants to clarify their views regarding the need to be informed about research involving whole genome sequencing (WGS).  We invited 1200 participants in the Mayo Clinic Biobank to complete a survey inquiring about their support for WGS; their interest in being recontacted before WGS of their biospecimens; whether they would consent to WGS if asked; and the acceptability of proceeding with WGS if sample donors could not be reached.  Six hundred eighty-seven biobank participants returned completed surveys (57% response). More than 96% of biobank participants were supportive of WGS and would give permission for WGS of their sample, if asked. Nonetheless, 61% of biobank participants felt they should be recontacted before WGS was done. Participants were divided regarding the permissibility of conducting WGS if efforts to recontact sample donors were unsuccessful.  Our findings highlight a potential discrepancy between the broad permissions granted by biobank participants at the time they donated biospecimens and their views about the application of WGS to their samples. Biobank participants appear to value the ability to confirm their commitment to genetic research when the studies in question involve WGS, a technological capacity they may not have anticipated at the time they donated their biospecimens. Efforts to reevaluate biobank participants' views about the acceptability of new technologies may help to ensure alignment of participants' current beliefs and research applications that would have been difficult to anticipate at the time biospecimens were collected.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Informed Consent;Whole Genome Sequencing;biobank;biorepository;ethics;informed consent;whole genome sequencing;

We propose a framework for the use of anticipatory waivers of consent that is empirically rooted in research that shows that children and adolescents are often developmentally capable of meaningful deliberation about the risks and benefits of participation in research. Accordingly, bright-line legal concepts of majority or competency do not accurately capture the emerging capacity for autonomous decision-making of many pediatric research participants and unnecessarily complicate the issues about contacting participants at the age of majority to obtain consent for the continued or first use of their biospecimens that were obtained during childhood.

First, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched the TWB as an infrastructure project under the leadership of Academia Sinica in 2012. We now believe that it is time that the TWB is transformed into a legal entity as a nondepartmental public body. This would not only ensure efficient, effective, and flexible operation, but would also facilitate cooperation with commercial entities. Second, we suggest that the TWB integrates with other Taiwanese biobanks to reduce cost, improve low utilization, and expand specimen collection. Third, self-financing is important if funding is ceased. Besides implementing a cost-recovery model, the commodities developed by the TWB (e.g., TWB 2.0 microarray) will help increase income. After each of these strategies has been discussed in detail, this article will conclude by highlighting how these practices can help improve biobank sustainability.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Specimen Handling;Taiwan;Taiwan Biobank;biobank networks;commercialization;non-departmental public body;sustainability;

However, BMI may also be a modifiable, causal risk factor for outcomes where there is no prior reason to suggest that a causal effect exists. We performed a MR phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) to search for the causal effects of BMI in UK Biobank (n = 334 968), using the PHESANT open-source phenome scan tool. A subset of identified associations were followed up with a formal two-stage instrumental variable analysis in UK Biobank, to estimate the causal effect of BMI on these phenotypes. Of the 22 922 tests performed, our MR-pheWAS identified 587 associations below a stringent P value threshold corresponding to a 5% estimated false discovery rate. These included many previously identified causal effects, for instance, an adverse effect of higher BMI on risk of diabetes and hypertension. We also identified several novel effects, including protective effects of higher BMI on a set of psychosocial traits, identified initially in our preliminary MR-pheWAS in circa 115,000 UK Biobank participants and replicated in a different subset of circa 223,000 UK Biobank participants. Our comprehensive MR-pheWAS identified potential causal effects of BMI on a large and diverse set of phenotypes.

We tested subcortical brain volume differences between 49 unaffected participants carrying at least one of the 12 copy number variants associated with schizophrenia in UK Biobank and 9063 individuals who did not carry any of the 93 copy number variants reported to be pathogenic. Our results show that CNV carriers have reduced volume in some of the subcortical structures previously shown to be reduced in schizophrenia.

Recently, Thomas Ploug and Soren Holm have developed an alternative to both specific and broad consent: a meta-consent framework. The aim here is to consider whether meta-consent provides a 'solution' to the biobank consent debate. We clarify what 'meta-consent' actually is (arguing that the label is a misnomer and 'consent à la carte' is more accurate). We identify problems with Ploug and Holm's arguments, and some challenges for meta-consent. We focus on whether there is any ethical obligation to provide consent à la carte. There may seem to be so, especially if we draw upon an unclear appeal to the ethical significance of 'respect for autonomy'. Similarly, there might seem to be an intuitive inference from the fact that ethically legitimate research requires informed consent to the conclusion that it thereby requires consent à la carte. It is shown that this line of inference is mistaken.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Informed Consent;biobank consent;biobanks;broad consent;consent;informed consent;meta-consent;

The National Cancer Institute's Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (BBRB) commissioned the Biobanking Financial Sustainability survey to better understand the challenges that biobanks face in supporting ongoing operations. A series of interviews with biobanking managers and an international focus group session informed the content of the survey. The design of the survey included five main sections, each containing questions related to primary topics as follows: general demographics, operations, funding sources, costs, and financial challenges. While the survey focused on financial issues and challenges, it also explored staffing and strategic planning as these issues relate to the sustainability of operations and financial support. U.S. and international biobanks were included in the survey. Biobanks in general are dependent on public funding and most biobanks do not have formal plans for the long-term stewardship of their collections. Respondents are working at a critical level of personnel and are not in a position to further reduce staffing. Smaller biobanks in particular need assistance in defining reasonable cost recovery user fees for biospecimens and related services. The survey results highlight several issues that are important for long-term biobank sustainability. It is critical to prepare for such issues as effective biobanking practices have increasingly been recognized as a key component for the advancement of precision medicine.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Financial Support;Humans;National Cancer Institute (U.S.);United States;biobank;biobanking;biobanking economics;economics;financial sustainability;repositories;

Medical advances made through biobanking research have limited reach if tissues are not obtained from a diverse sample of individuals. Within, we describe the process of transitioning a small group of Hispanic community members who met regularly into a more formal Hispanic Community Advisory Board (HCAB) for the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. The sole purpose of the HCAB was to provide input and feedback on GTEx and, specifically, how researchers can best address the concerns of the Hispanic community related to tissue donation. This initial purpose was adapted to be responsive to the HCAB's request to include educating others in the Hispanic community who were not a part of the advisory board about genomic biobanking. While HCAB members' knowledge of biobanking was limited, a strong need for culturally tailored information about the impact of biobanking medical discoveries and their potential benefit to the Hispanic community was expressed. The HCAB's feedback guided revisions to GTEx study documents to specifically address concerns about language use, clarity, and context including the need for consent forms to address cultural concerns and fears. HCAB members also collaborated on the development of a walk-through exhibition which provided a visual, narrative-based explanation of GTEx and the process of tissue donation for research and biobanking purposes. The HCAB demonstrated the value of including community participation in scientific research projects, for both scientists and lay communities, and underscored the importance of developing community engagement approaches that are adaptable and responsive to community needs. Our experience with the HCAB serves as exemplar for a unique paradigm of community inclusiveness and education in research.",,,Community participation;Genomics;Hispanic Americans;Tissue banks;

965,ukbREST: efficient and streamlined data access for reproducible research in large biobanks.,"Milton Pividori,Hae Kyung Im",,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395166/," Large biobanks, such as UK Biobank with half a million participants, are changing the scale and availability of genotypic and phenotypic data for researchers to ask fundamental questions about the biology of health and disease. The breadth of the UK Biobank data is enabling discoveries at an unprecedented pace. However, this size and complexity pose new challenges to investigators who need to keep the accruing data up to date, comply with potential consent changes, and efficiently and reproducibly extract subsets of the data to answer specific scientific questions. Here we propose a tool called ukbREST designed for the UK Biobank study (easily extensible to other biobanks), which allows authorized users to efficiently retrieve phenotypic and genetic data. It exposes a REST API that makes data highly accessible inside a private and secure network, allowing the data specification in a human readable text format easily shareable with other researchers. These characteristics make ukbREST an important tool to make biobank's valuable data more readily accessible to the research community and facilitate reproducibility of the analysis, a key aspect of science. It is implemented in Python using the Flask-RESTful framework for the API, and it is under the MIT license. It works with PostgreSQL and a Docker image is available for easy deployment.

To ensure that the Hispanic population benefits from advances in public health and medicine, including personalized medicine, there is a need to increase their participation in clinical trials and biobanking. There is a great need for improving awareness and addressing concerns individuals may have about participation. The purpose of this study was to adapt, implement, and evaluate educational materials about clinical trials and biobanking for Hispanic individuals. We adapted existing materials based on focus group data. We then trained four promotoras de salud to deliver education to Hispanic adults in community settings in Houston, TX. The promotoras educated 101 Hispanic adults, 51 on biobanking and 50 on clinical trials. Study staff administered brief pre- and post-test questionnaires that measured benefits, barriers, norms, self-efficacy, and intention to participate in either clinical trials or biobanking. Our sample was predominately female (83%) and Spanish-speaking (69%) and made less than $25,000 a year (87%). This intervention increased perceived benefits of participating in biobanking and clinical trials, self-efficacy for donating biospecimens, and intention to participate in biobanking if invited. Perceived barriers to participating declined. This study demonstrated that brief education can result in improved perceptions and attitudes related to participation in biobanking and clinical trials, and could increase participation.

Researching FIs in resources with large-scale genetic and phenotypic data will provide insights into the causes and consequences of frailty. Thus, we aimed to develop an FI using UK Biobank data, a cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged and older adults. An FI was calculated using 49 self-reported questionnaire items on traits covering health, presence of diseases and disabilities, and mental well-being, according to standard protocol. We used multiple imputation to derive FI values for the entire eligible sample in the presence of missing item data (N = 500,336). To validate the measure, we assessed associations of the FI with age, sex, and risk of all-cause mortality (follow-up ≤ 9.7 years) using linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Mean FI in the cohort was 0.125 (SD = 0.075), and there was a curvilinear trend toward higher values in older participants. FI values were also marginally higher on average in women than in men. In survival models, 10% higher baseline frailty (ie, a 0.1 FI increment) was associated with higher risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.62-1.68). Associations were stronger in younger participants than in older participants, and in men than in women (hazard ratios: 1.72 vs. 1.56, respectively). The FI is a valid measure of frailty in UK Biobank.

However, biobank storage and use of patient-derived organoids raises specific ethical and practical challenges that demand sound governance. We examined the perspectives of professionals affiliated with CF or organoids on the ethical aspects of organoid biobanking for CF precision medicine. By conducting this study parallel to the process of innovation and development of organoid biobanking, its findings are valuable for the design of responsible governance frameworks. To identify relevant themes and attitudes we conducted 21 semi-structured qualitative interviews with professionals in the field of organoid technology, biobanking, or CF research and care. We identified three key challenges, as well as the suggestions of professionals on how to address them: (1) The challenges associated with commercial involvement, trust, and ownership, (2) Navigating the blurring boundary between research and clinical care, (3) Appropriate approaches to the informed consent procedure. Sound governance of organoid biobanks aimed at precision medicine requires coming to terms with the fact that its stakeholders no longer belong to separate domains.

969,Landscape of Pediatric Biobanking: Challenges and Current Efforts.,"Lalita Wadhwa",,,,,2020,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33296265/,"Diseases that manifest themselves in the pediatric age group frequently have a more diverse spectrum of abnormalities and a greater rarity than diseases that are primarily seen in adults. The complexity and the relatively small populations with specific diseases are factors that have hindered progress in the treatment of pediatric disorders. Personalized medical therapies that are specifically tailored for individuals with unusual or unique problems have great potential to assist in overcoming these factors that have been a bottleneck to pediatric medical success. Personalization of therapies will necessarily be data driven and will require delineation of the proteomic, genomic, epigenomic, and immune characteristics of patients in comparison to the general population. It follows that there is a need to provide researchers with accessible high-quality pediatric tissue collections to facilitate the acquisition of the molecular information needed to support personalized medicine. Because of the unusual nature of many pediatric diseases, sample pools from individual institutions are often too small to adequately power definitive studies. Thus, etiological and translational research in this area are increasingly relying on biobanking networks to provide investigators with adequate numbers of tissue samples. Several pediatric biobanking networks have been formed, which are aimed at increasing the power of research studies and desired pools of high-quality samples. However, despite the concerted efforts, these multicenter networks and collaborations have met with mixed outcomes owing to increasing complexities and heterogeneity in the biobanking arena. While there have been challenges and roadblocks, there also have been some positive outcomes that have had paradigm impacts on diagnosis, study, and treatment of specific diseases. This article highlights the need for establishing pediatric biobanks, how current efforts in pediatric biobanking are influencing the pediatric research landscape, and attempts to identify practical impediments that continue to hamper advancements for the future.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Child;Genomics;Humans;Proteomics;Research Personnel;biobank networks;pediatric;personalized medicine;

We estimated the risk for prevalent hypertension with incident respiratory diseases over mean follow-up of 8 years among 377,143 British participants in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization of blood pressure on pneumonia was implemented using 75 independent, genome-wide significant variants associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures among 299,024 individuals not in the UK Biobank. Secondary analyses with pulmonary function tests were performed. In total, 107,310 participants (30%) had hypertension at UK Biobank enrollment, and 9,969 (3%) developed pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension was independently associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.29-1.43; p < 0.001), as well as other incident respiratory diseases. Genetic predisposition to a 5 mm Hg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia for systolic blood pressure (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20; p = 0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increased blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced performance on pulmonary function tests (p < 0.001). These results suggest that elevated blood pressure increases risk for pneumonia. Maintaining adequate blood pressure control, in addition to other measures, may reduce risk for pneumonia. S.M.Z.

We report the first assessment of biobank enrollees' comprehension under an  integrated consent  process, where patients were asked to enroll in a research biobank as part of their normal healthcare experience. A number of healthcare systems have implemented similar integrated consent processes for biobanking, but it is unknown how much patients understand after enrolling under these conditions.  We recruited patients who enrolled in a biobank while in a healthcare setting when receiving ordinary care. We assessed knowledge of consent materials using 11 true/false questions drawn from a well-known biobank knowledge test. After reviewing the results from 114 participants, we revised the consent form and repeated the knowledge assessment with 144 different participants.  Participants scored poorly on the knowledge test in both rounds, with no significant differences in overall scores or individual items between the rounds. In Phase 1, participants answered 53% of the questions correctly, 25% incorrectly, and 22%  I don't know.  In Phase 2, participants answered 53% of questions correctly, 24% incorrectly, and 23%  I don't know.  Participants scored particularly poorly on questions about data sharing and accessing medical records.  Enrollees under an integrated consent model had significant misunderstandings that persisted despite an attempt to improve information specifically about those topics in a consent form. These results raise challenges for current approaches that attribute misunderstanding to overly complex consent forms. They also suggest that the pressures of the clinic may compound other problems with patient understanding of biobank consent.

Some participants said they understood the information shared with them. Some said they participated due to the perceived benefits of the reimbursement and convenience of free healthcare. Most who did not participate said it was due to logistical rather than ethical concerns. None of the participants recalled aspects of biobanking and genetics from the consent process. Although most people understood the study objectives, we observed challenges to identifying language appropriate to explain biobanking and genetic testing to our target population. Engagement with communities to adopt contextually relevant terminologies that participants can understand is crucial.

To better position the biobanking community to cope with current and future challenges, the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) COVID-19 Response Task Force was convened to identify needs and gaps in biobanking tools (existing resources that support good practice), for example, standards, best practices, business, etc. and to make recommendations to benefit the community. Toward these goals, the Task Force assembled a set of questions to explore individual biobanks' experiences, with emphasis on identification of key challenges and approaches, including tools employed. A survey was designed with the use of these questions and administered by ISBER. This article presents a summary of the aggregated data obtained from the survey responses, illustrating some of the major issues encountered and identifying which tools the survey respondents found most useful. In particular, this article focuses on the challenges identified during the early months of the COVID-19 era. Recommendations are provided to support biobank emergency preparedness for the future, address lessons learned, and propose solutions to bridge identified gaps.

Compliance with biobanking standards and the implementation of quality management systems (QMS) can improve the quality of the biological material and associated data (BMaD). By undergoing third-party assessments, biobanks can demonstrate compliance to these standards and instill confidence in their users. In the 8 months following the publication of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20387:2018 General Requirements for Biobanking standard, the Cornell Veterinary Biobank (CVB) became compliant with the standard requirements, including developing and implementing a QMS. This was achieved through the documentation of all biobanking processes, demonstration of personnel competence, the stringent control of documents and records, and ongoing evaluation of processes and the QMS. Procedures describing the control of documents and records were implemented first to provide a foundation on which to build the QMS, followed by procedures for documenting the identification of risks and opportunities, improvements, and corrective actions following nonconforming outputs. Internal audit and management review programs were developed to verify QMS performance and to monitor quality objectives. Procedures for the governance and management of the biobank were developed, including the following: organizational structure; confidentiality and impartiality policies; facility and equipment maintenance, calibration, and monitoring; personnel training and competency; and evaluation of external providers. All processes on scope were described, along with the validation and verification of methods, to ensure the fitness-for-purpose of the BMaD and the reproducibility of biobanking processes. Training sessions were held during implementation of the QMS to ensure all personnel would conform to the procedures. In April 2019, the CVB underwent third-party assessment by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) and became the first biobank in the world to receive accreditation to ISO 20387:2018.",,,Accreditation;Biological Specimen Banks;Laboratories;Reference Standards;Reproducibility of Results;ISO;accreditation;biobank;quality management;standards;

Two independent studies about biobank governance in Europe and Canada identified a lack of governance-related information provided by biobanks on their public webpages. This lack of transparency stands in contrast to governance best practice guidelines highlighting the importance of transparency as a principle of good governance. Transparency is especially important as many biobanks are publicly funded, and it contributes to accountability and supports the development of donor trust in biobanks. Empirical evidence shows that the public supports greater transparency about biobank governance. It will be important that information provided online is relevant and accessible for a variety of different stakeholders (e.g. public and private sector scientists and institutions, donors and potential donors, members of the public). Transparency standards, however, need to be proportionate to avoid the situation that only large-scale biobanks can allocate appropriate resources to fulfil them. Implementing adequate standards of transparency about biobanks' governance will increase accountability but also allow current and future participants to make more informed decisions about their participation in biobank activities.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;Europe;Humans;Social Responsibility;biobank governance;communication;information;public relations;transparency;trustworthiness;

These requirements are further specified by the Article 29 Working Party (WP29)-an EU advisory body currently known as the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). Unfortunately, their guidance is cause for some confusion. While the GDPR allows participants to give broad consent for research when specific research purposes are still unknown, the WP29 guidelines suggest that additional consent for specific uses should be obtained in addition to broad consent when this becomes applicable. This discrepancy elicits the question whether clinical biobanks can fail the requirement of consent if they obtain broad consent, but not a specific consent for each biomedical study. We analysed this discrepancy within the framework of contextual integrity, in order to describe the context-relative informational norms that govern information flows in clinical biobanks. However, our analysis demonstrates that there is no uniform set of norms that can be applied to all clinical biobanks. As such, neither the GDPR nor the WP29 guidance can act as a  one size fits all  approach to all clinical biobanks. Rather, differences between clinical biobanks-especially regarding the scientific aims and patient populations-make the case for context-relative norms that determine the appropriate type of consent.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Computer Security;European Union;Humans;Informed Consent;Article 29 working party;Bio bank;Consent;General data protection regulation;

Drawing on document analysis about the BBMRI-ERIC and multi-sited fieldwork with biobankers in Spain from a science and technology studies approach, we explore what biobanks are expected to do and become under the BBMRI-ERIC framework, and how infrastructural transitions promote particular transformations in biobanking practices. The primary purpose of biobanks in Europe is presented as being to become mediators in contemporary biomedical research (global sharing nodes) distribution, and distributed nodes of samples and their associated data. We argue that infrastructural transitions are complicated and heterogeneous, giving rise to unattended local concerns on adjusting their practices to fit into the BBMRI-ERIC framework, even for non-members, as the case of Spain illustrates, where  old practices  of collection and storage are questioned. In this article, we aim to encourage qualitative studies to explore the lags between pan-European policies and prospects, different contextual interpretations, and biobanking reconfigurations as an opportunity to explore what that lag is made of (e.g. tensions with  old practices,  unresolved conflicts with the national agendas, reservations on a possible centralization of the biobanking practices by regional biobanks, lack of funding, etc.).

We conducted a qualitative focus group study with biobank participants (N = 54) who were notified by mail of an individual research result indicating increased risk for adverse events associated with the common cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We employed a framework approach for analysis. Our results revealed three themes illustrating participants' questions and uncertainty, especially regarding how to share results with health providers and family members, and remember them over time. Participants valued results for themselves and others, and for the future of medicine. Risk perception was framed by health identity.  Toxicity narratives,  or familiarity with another's adverse reaction to chemotherapy, increased the sense of importance participants reported. These focus group results highlight research participant remaining questions and high valuation of PGx results, even when unexpected.

The development of direct-to-consumer genetic testing cannot leave aside some considerations on how the samples are managed once the analyses have been completed and the customer has received a response. The possibility that these samples are maintained by the structure for future research uses, explains the definition, which has been proposed in the literature, of these structures such as private genetic biobanks. The most relevant aspects that may impact ethical aspects, allowing a comparison between the public and private dimensions of genetic biobanks, are mainly transparency and participant/donor trust. The article aims to analyze the main line of ethical debate related to the mentioned practices and to explore whether market-based and consumer rights regarding DTC genetic testing can be counterbalanced by healthcare system developments based on policies that encourage the donation of samples in the context of public biobanks.

Output metrics and cost-consequence analyses can allow biobanks to achieve efficiencies, and improve the quality and/or quantity of their outputs.

Evidence on socioeconomic impacts is important to understand because it can help governments, policy makers and decision makers allocate resources efficiently and effectively. We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effects of eight health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes) and five health risk factors [alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking] on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes in 336 997 men and women of White British ancestry in UK Biobank, aged between 39 and 72 years. Outcomes included annual household income, employment, deprivation [measured by the Townsend deprivation index (TDI)], degree-level education, happiness, loneliness and 13 other social and socioeconomic outcomes. Results suggested that BMI, smoking and alcohol intake affect many socioeconomic outcomes. For example, smoking was estimated to reduce household income [mean difference = -£22 838, 95% confidence interval (CI): -£31 354 to -£14 321] and the chance of owning accommodation [absolute percentage change (APC) = -20.8%, 95% CI: -28.2% to -13.4%], of being satisfied with health (APC = -35.4%, 95% CI: -51.2% to -19.5%) and of obtaining a university degree (APC = -65.9%, 95% CI: -81.4% to -50.4%), while also increasing deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.44, approximately 216% of a decile of TDI). There was evidence that asthma decreased household income, the chance of obtaining a university degree and the chance of cohabiting, and migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly leisure or social activity, especially in men. For other associations, estimates were null. Higher BMI, alcohol intake and smoking were all estimated to adversely affect multiple social and socioeconomic outcomes. Effects were not detected between health conditions and socioeconomic outcomes using Mendelian randomization, with the exceptions of depression, asthma and migraines.

Interviews and focus groups were conducted in order to present a description and analysis of meetings in which broad consent took place and to examine the role of recruiters in the patients' decision-making and in building trust in the Lausanne University Hospital Institutional Biobank (BIL). Our findings suggest that patient broad consent to biobanking is strongly related to its setting. BIL recruiters' were aware of their role as ambassadors of the BIL and their responsibility towards patients. Patient interviewees were sensitive to the quality of the information delivered, the timing of the consent request and the recruiters' attitudes and behaviours, including the presence of the white coat. Participating in the BIL also seemed to reinforce the patient's self-esteem and perceived efficacy, particularly since they are themselves ill and inactive when requested to participate. Recruiters and participants report that participation may be motivated by fundamental (existential) goals. Organisational factors also affected recruiters' activity and the broad consent procedure raising several ethical issues.

998,Transformation of the Taiwan Biobank 3.0: vertical and horizontal integration.,"Jui-Chu Lin,Wesley Wei-Wen Hsiao,Chien-Te Fan",,,,,2020,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762757/,"Researchers expect a high quality of biospecimens/data and value-added services from biobanks. Therefore, the concept of  biobank 3.0  was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of income and revenue models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a  physically  vertical integration driven by the TWB and a  virtually  horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users. To these ends, the authors highlight key issues that include, but are not limited to, the harmonization of relevant ELSI standards for various biobanks' integrations; the value-added services and the efficiency of Big Data Era related research and/or precision medicine development, and financial concerns related to biobank sustainability. This paper concludes by discussing how greater participant engagement and the uptake of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can be used in partnership with vertical and horizontal integration as part of a four-pronged approach to promote biobank sustainability, and facilitate the TWB 3.0 transformation.",,,"Artificial Intelligence;Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Population Health;Research Personnel;Taiwan;Artificial intelligence (AI);Big Data;Biobank 3.0;Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI);Horizontal integration;Vertical integration"

We aimed to acquire insights into the differences between participants and refusers of participation in a Dutch population-based biobank. Accordingly, we assessed the demographic and prosocial intrapersonal characteristics of respondents who participated (n = 2615) or refused to participate (n = 404) in the Lifelines biobank and databank. Our results indicated that health-related values critically influence participation decisions. The participation threshold for Lifelines was determined by an absence of health-related values and of trust in government. Therefore, considering these factors in communication and recruitment strategies could enhance participation in biomedical research. No indications were found of a stronger general prosociality of participants or their trust in researchers beyond the context of biobanking. This emphasizes the contextual understanding of the decision of participation in biobanking. Our findings may contribute to improving recruitment strategies by incorporating relevant values and/or highlighting prosocial benefits. Moreover, they foreground the need to address trust issues in collaborations between data repositories and commercial companies. Future research should explore how prosocial intrapersonal characteristics drive participation and withdrawal decisions and relate to contextual attributes.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Databases, Factual;Demography;Female;Genetic Privacy;Humans;Male;Netherlands;Patient Participation;Socioeconomic Factors;Tissue Donors;Trust"
1001,Public awareness of and attitudes towards research biobanks in Latvia.,"S Mezinska,J Kaleja,I Mileiko,D Santare,V Rovite,L Tzivian",,,,,2020,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32736554/," Public awareness and engagement are among the main prerequisites for protecting the rights of research participants and for successful and sustainable functioning of research biobanks. The aim of our study was to analyse public awareness and attitudes towards research biobanks in Latvia, and to compare these data with the results of the 2010 Eurobarometer study. We also analysed the influence of awareness and attitudes towards biobanks on willingness to participate in biobank studies and on preferred type of informed consent. We developed a 12-question survey repeating seven questions about biobanks from the 2010 Eurobarometer questionnaire and adding five others. After describing the study variables, we performed a two-stage analysis of the results. In the first stage we analysed differences between the answers from 2010 and 2019 and conducted univariate analyses of relationships among particular variables, and between those variables and the socio-demographic characteristics of participants. In the second stage we investigated multivariable associations of willingness to participate and type of consent with awareness, trust and the socio-economic characteristics of participants. According to our study, the general public in Latvia is still not well informed about research biobanks. Fewer respondents have heard about research biobanks than in 2010. At the same time, the number of respondents who are willing to donate biological samples and personal data to a biobank has increased, e.g. the number of respondents who would definitely or probably be willing to provide information about themselves has increased from 25.8.% to 40.7 since 2010. Overall, concerns about the donation of different types of biological samples and data to a biobank have slightly decreased. Public awareness about biobanks is important for their sustainability. It needs to be increased not only by traditional methods of informing the public, but also by more innovative and participatory approaches, e.g. by citizen science projects. There is a need to strengthen the public visibility and trustworthiness of ethics committees in Latvia in the field of biobanking.",,,Attitude;Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Informed Consent;Latvia;Surveys and Questionnaires;Informed consent;Latvia;Public attitudes;Public opinion;Research biobanks;

We found that the two groups interestingly shared worries concerning the risks involved in possible novel uses of their biobank material, even though they drew opposite conclusions from their worries. Revisiting these interviews today reveals a remarkable relevance to present concerns, since the possible developments that worried ex-participants and participants 16 years ago now are becoming realities. Drawing on conceptual distinctions by sociologist and philosopher Niklas Luhmann, we argue that while ex-participants express a loss of trust in the biobank institution to manage the use of their biobank material in a legitimate way, remaining participants expressed confidence in the management of the biobank institution to secure their interests.

The exome and genome sequencing datasets of the UK Biobank (n = 50,000) and cohorts of cognitively healthy elderly (n = 751) were queried for cysteine-altering  variants. Brain MRIs of individuals harboring such variants were scored according to Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging criteria, and clinical information was extracted with ICD-10 codes. Clinical and neuroimaging data were compared to age- and sex-matched UK Biobank controls and clinically diagnosed patients from the Dutch cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) registry. We identified 108 individuals harboring a cysteine-altering  variant (2.2 of 1,000), of whom 75% have a variant that has previously been reported in CADASIL pedigrees. Almost all variants were located in 1 of the NOTCH3 protein epidermal growth factor-like repeat domains 7 to 34. White matter hyperintensity lesion load was higher in individuals with  variants than in controls ( = 0.006) but lower than in patients with CADASIL with the same variants ( < 0.001). Almost half of the 24 individuals with brain MRI had a Fazekas score of 0 or 1 up to age 70 years. There was no increased risk of stroke. Although community-dwelling individuals harboring a cysteine-altering  variant have a higher small vessel disease MRI burden than controls, almost half have no MRI abnormalities up to age 70 years. This shows that  cysteine altering variants are associated with an extremely broad phenotypic spectrum, ranging from CADASIL to nonpenetrance.",,,"Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Brain;CADASIL;Case-Control Studies;Cysteine;Ethnicity;Female;Genotype;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Mutation;Netherlands;Neuroimaging;Penetrance;Receptor, Notch3;Registries;United Kingdom;White Matter"

There is significant heterogeneity to this progression of glycemia after onset of diabetes, yet the factors that influence glycemic progression are not well understood. Given the tremendous burden of diabetes in the Chinese population, and limited knowledge on factors that influence glycemia, we aim to identify the clinical and genetic predictors for glycemic progression in Chinese patients with T2D. In 1995-2007, 7,091 insulin-naïve Chinese patients (mean age 56.8 ± 13.3 [SD] years; mean age of T2D onset 51.1 ± 12.7 years; 47% men; 28.4% current or ex-smokers; median duration of diabetes 4 [IQR: 1-9] years; mean HbA1c 7.4% ± 1.7%; mean body mass index [BMI] 25.3 ± 4.0 kg/m2) were followed prospectively in the Hong Kong Diabetes Register. We examined associations of BMI and other clinical and genetic factors with glycemic progression defined as requirement of continuous insulin treatment, or 2 consecutive HbA1c ≥8.5% while on ≥2 oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs), with validation in another multicenter cohort of Hong Kong Diabetes Biobank. During a median follow-up period of 8.8 (IQR: 4.8-13.3) years, incidence of glycemic progression was 48.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.3-49.8) per 1,000 person-years with 2,519 patients started on insulin. Among the latter, 33.2% had a lag period of 1.3 years before insulin was initiated. Risk of progression was associated with extremes of BMI and high HbA1c. On multivariate Cox analysis, early age at diagnosis, microvascular complications, high triglyceride levels, and tobacco use were additional independent predictors for glycemic progression. A polygenic risk score (PRS) including 123 known risk variants for T2D also predicted rapid progression to insulin therapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.07 [95% CI 1.03-1.12] per SD; P = 0.001), with validation in the replication cohort (HR: 1.24 [95% CI 1.06-1.46] per SD; P = 0.008). A PRS using 63 BMI-related variants predicted BMI (beta [SE] = 0.312 [0.057] per SD; P = 5.84 × 10-8) but not glycemic progression (HR: 1.01 [95% CI 0.96-1.05] per SD; P = 0.747). Limitations of this study include potential misdiagnosis of T2D and lack of detailed data of drug use during follow-up in the replication cohort. Our results show that approximately 5% of patients with T2D failed OGLDs annually in this clinic-based cohort. The independent associations of modifiable and genetic risk factors allow more precise identification of high-risk patients for early intensive control of multiple risk factors to prevent glycemic progression.",,,"Adult;Aged;Asian People;Biological Specimen Banks;Blood Glucose;Body Mass Index;Cholesterol, HDL;Cohort Studies;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;Female;Glycated Hemoglobin;Hong Kong;Humans;Male;Metformin;Middle Aged;Obesity;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Treatment Outcome"

Previous studies have highlighted fine-scale population structure in the UK on a North-West to South-East cline, but the impact of unmeasured geographical confounding on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex human traits in the UK Biobank has not been investigated. We considered 368 325 white British individuals from the UK Biobank and performed GWAS of their birth location. We demonstrate that widely used approaches to adjust for population structure, including principal component analysis and mixed modelling with a random effect for a genetic relationship matrix, cannot fully account for the fine-scale geographical confounding in the UK Biobank. We observe significant genetic correlation of birth location with a range of lifestyle-related traits, including body-mass index and fat mass, hypertension and lung function, even after adjustment for population structure. Variants driving associations with birth location are also strongly associated with many of these lifestyle-related traits after correction for population structure, indicating that there could be environmental factors that are confounded with geography that have not been adequately accounted for. Our findings highlight the need for caution in the interpretation of lifestyle-related trait GWAS in UK Biobank, particularly in loci demonstrating strong residual association with birth location.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Biomarkers;Body Mass Index;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetics, Population;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Surveys and Questionnaires"

Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (P = 0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (P = 0.010) and death (P = 0.002) in non-whites (predominantly South Asians and Afro-Caribbeans), compared with whites. These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities.

The EPIS framework guided discussions in four focus groups with program coordinators ( = 27) and one-on-one interviews with community leaders ( = 15) from CBOs and FBOs. Participants reported that community members were aware of HPV vaccination but did not know of the link between HPV infection and cancers. Awareness for biobanking was low. HPV vaccination and biobanking were not priority health concerns among community members due to other health issues. However, HPV vaccination and biobanking were considered sensitive health topics. For HPV vaccination, sensitivity was due to concerns that HPV vaccination promoted sex among adolescents, while for biobanking, sensitivity was due to historical abuses of people of color by the medical community. Participants reported that program coordinators' awareness of HPV vaccination and biobanking depended on their organizations' mission. Neither were considered a priority health concern due to lack of funding. Few EBP were available on HPV vaccination and biobanking. Recommendations on culturally-appropriate strategies for engaging community members on HPV vaccination and biobanking EBP are discussed.

Cross-sectional study. A total of 396,707 (68.8% women, age 38 to 73) participants from UK Biobank. Thirty-three biomarkers, standardized to sex-specific z-scores, were included in the analysis. Associations between these biomarkers and sarcopenia, defined using EWGSOP2 criteria, were examined using multiple linear regression. Higher concentrations of rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, cystatin C, sex hormone-binding globulin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total protein, as well as lower concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1, albumin, creatinine, sodium, and systolic blood pressure, were associated with sarcopenia in both men and women. However, some of the associations differed by sex. Sarcopenia was associated with higher concentrations of phosphate, lipoprotein A, and lower of diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, urea, glucose, total bilirubin, and testosterone in women only, and with higher concentrations of high-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, and direct bilirubin and lower values of apolipoprotein A, vitamin D, and apolipoprotein B in men only. Several biomarkers were associated with sarcopenia in men and women using the new EWGSOP2 statement. However, some of these associations and their magnitude differed between men and women.

While the biobanking community is in general committed to such principles, little is known about precisely which governance strategies biobanks adopt to meet those objectives. We conducted an exploratory analysis of governance mechanisms adopted by research biobanks, including genetic biobanks, located in Europe and Canada. We reviewed information available on the websites of 69 biobanks, and directly contacted them for additional information. Our study identified six types of commonly adopted governance strategies: communication, compliance, expert advice, external review, internal procedures, and partnerships. Each strategy is implemented through different mechanisms including, independent ethics assessment, informed consent processes, quality management, data access control, legal compliance, standard operating procedures and external certification. Such mechanisms rely on a wide range of bodies, committees and actors from both within and outside the biobanks themselves. We found that most biobanks aim to be transparent about their governance mechanisms, but could do more to provide more complete and detailed information about them. In particular, the retrievable information, while showing efforts to ensure biobanks operate in a legitimate way, does not specify in sufficient detail how governance mechanisms support accountability, nor how they ensure oversight of research operations. This state of affairs can potentially undermine biobanks' trustworthiness to stakeholders and the public in a long-term perspective. Given the ever-increasing reliance of biomedical research on large biological repositories and their associated databases, we recommend that biobanks increase their efforts to future-proof their governance.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Communication;Confidentiality;Databases, Factual;Government Regulation;Health Policy;Humans"

We report 77 traits that are significantly associated with depression-PRS, in both discovery and replication analyses. Mendelian Randomisation analysis supports a potential causal effect of liability to depression on brain white matter microstructure (β: 0.125 to 0.868, p < 0.043).

1016,The reported impact of public involvement in biobanks: A scoping review.,"Lidia Luna Puerta,Will Kendall,Bethan Davies,Sophie Day,Helen Ward",,,,,2020,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378306/," Biobanks increasingly employ public involvement and engagement strategies, though few studies have explored their impact. This review aims to (a) investigate how the impact of public involvement in biobanks is reported and conceptualized by study authors; in order to (b) suggest how the research community might re-conceptualize the impact of public involvement in biobanks. A systematic literature search of three electronic databases and the INVOLVE Evidence Library in January 2019. Studies commenting on the impact of public involvement in a biobank were included, and a narrative review was conducted. Forty-one studies covering thirty-one biobanks were included, with varying degrees of public involvement. Impact was categorized according to where it was seen: 'the biobank', 'people involved' and 'the wider research community'. Most studies reported involvement in a 'functional' way, in relation to improved rates of participation in the biobank. Broader forms of impact were reported but were vaguely defined and measured. This review highlights a lack of clarity of purpose and varied researcher conceptualizations of involvement. We pose three areas for further research and consideration by biobank researchers and public involvement practitioners. Functional approaches to public involvement in biobanking limit impact. This conceptualization of involvement emerges from an entrenched technical understanding that ignores its political nature, complicated by long-standing disagreement about the values of public involvement. This study urges a re-imagination of impact, re-conceptualized as a two-way learning process. More support will help researchers and members of the public to undergo such reflective exercises.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Biomedical Research;Humans;Publications;Research Personnel;biobank;impact;public involvement;

Cholangiocytes express both oestrogen receptor-α and -β, and oestrogens positively modulate cholangiocyte proliferation. Studies in women and men have reported higher circulating oestradiol is associated with increased ICC risk, further supporting a hormonal aetiology. However, no observational studies have examined the associations between exogenous hormone use and reproductive factors, as proxies of endogenous hormone levels, and risk of ICC. We harmonised data from 1,107,498 women who enroled in 12 North American-based cohort studies (in the Liver Cancer Pooling Project, LCPP) and the UK Biobank between 1980-1998 and 2006-2010, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence internals (CI). Then, meta-analytic techniques were used to combine the estimates from the LCPP (n = 180 cases) and the UK Biobank (n = 57 cases). Hysterectomy was associated with a doubling of ICC risk (HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.27-3.09), compared to women aged 50-54 at natural menopause. Long-term oral contraceptive use (9+ years) was associated with a 62% increased ICC risk (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.03-2.55). There was no association between ICC risk and other exogenous hormone use or reproductive factors.

Accurate PGS construction requires prediction models that are both adaptive to different genetic architectures and scalable to biobank scale datasets with millions of individuals and tens of millions of genetic variants. Here, we develop such a method called Deterministic Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (DBSLMM). DBSLMM relies on a flexible modeling assumption on the effect size distribution to achieve robust and accurate prediction performance across a range of genetic architectures. DBSLMM also relies on a simple deterministic search algorithm to yield an approximate analytic estimation solution using summary statistics only. The deterministic search algorithm, when paired with further algebraic innovations, results in substantial computational savings. With simulations, we show that DBSLMM achieves scalable and accurate prediction performance across a range of realistic genetic architectures. We then apply DBSLMM to analyze 25 traits in UK Biobank. For these traits, compared to existing approaches, DBSLMM achieves an average of 2.03%-101.09% accuracy gain in internal cross-validations. In external validations on two separate datasets, including one from BioBank Japan, DBSLMM achieves an average of 14.74%-522.74% accuracy gain. In these real data applications, DBSLMM is 1.03-28.11 times faster and uses only 7.4%-24.8% of physical memory as compared to other multiple regression-based PGS methods. Overall, DBSLMM represents an accurate and scalable method for constructing PGS in biobank scale datasets.",,,"Bayes Theorem;Databases, Factual;Datasets as Topic;Female;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Reproducibility of Results;Sample Size;United Kingdom;White People;UK Biobank;complex traits;deterministic Bayesian sparse linear mixed model;polygenic risk score;polygenic score"

Although the argument for dynamic consent has been made on theoretical grounds, empirical studies evaluating the potential utility of dynamic consent are needed to enhance deliberations about the merits of dynamic consent. Few studies have assessed such considerations as whether donor preferences may change over time or if participants would use a dynamic consent mechanism to modify preferences when they change. We administered a 66-item survey to participants in a large DNA biobank. The survey sought to gauge the stability of donor preferences specified at the time of biobank enrollment, specifically the stability of donors' preference regarding posthumous availability of biospecimens to next-of-kin. We received 1164 completed surveys for a response rate of 72%. Forty percent of respondents indicated a preference regarding sample availability on the survey (T2) that was inconsistent with the preference they had expressed when they enrolled in the biobank (T1). Most (94%) individuals with inconsistent preferences regarding sample availability had initially restricted sample availability at T1 but were comfortable with broader availability when asked at the time of the survey (T2). Our findings demonstrate that preferences regarding sample use expressed at the time of enrollment in a DNA biobank may not be reliable indicators of donor preferences over time. These findings lend empirical support to the case for a dynamic consent model in which biobank participants are approached over time to clarify their views regarding sample use.",,,"Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biological Specimen Banks;Female;Humans;Informed Consent;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Preference;Tissue Donors"

Cox regression analyses were used to study the association between the daily intake of the above beverages and all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic, economic, lifestyle and dietary confounders. Total energy intake, total sugar intake and percentage of energy derived from sugar were comparable among participants who consumed > 2/day sugar-sweetened beverages and > 2/day fruit/vegetable juices (10,221 kJ/day versus 10,381 kJ/day; 183 g versus 190 g; 30.6% versus 31.0%).

An association between artificially sweetened beverage intake and mortality did not persist after excluding deaths in the first 2 years of follow-up (landmark analysis) nor after excluding participants with recent weight loss. Furthermore, the inverse association between fruit/vegetable juice intake and mortality did not persist after additional adjustment for a diet quality score. Higher mortality is associated with sugar-sweetened beverages specifically. The lack of an adverse association with fruit/vegetable juices suggests that source of sugar may be important and the association with artificially sweetened beverage may reflect reverse causation.",,,Adult;Biological Specimen Banks;Cohort Studies;Female;Fruit and Vegetable Juices;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Mortality;Prospective Studies;Sugars;Sweetening Agents;United Kingdom;Diet;Fruit juice;Mortality;Sugar;UK Biobank;

Public relations and communication activities emerged to be extremely important in the successful development of this project. To gain insights into the contributions of these activities, we divided the public relations and communication activities for the project into three phases based on the situations surrounding the project. Prior to the start of the cohort study (Phase I), a cooperative relationship was established with a focus on concluding cooperation agreements with local governments. Until the participants reached the target number (Phase II), we actively communicated with the media to publicize the project. During the phase in which use of the constructed biobank is promoted (Phase III), for ensuring the industrial utilization of the biobank, visits from the industry are promoted. Throughout the execution of these activities, we explored the best strategies for building relationships with multiple stakeholders like local government, media and industry. By paying attention to these phases that have been changing according to the project's progress, we were able to adapt the strategies and methods of public relations and communication. The success of these activities has enabled the overall project to progress smoothly.

However, the safe storage of germplasm and the prevention of disease transmission continue to be potential hazards of disease transmission through embryo transfer. This study aimed to demonstrate the potential risk of cross-infection of embryos from contaminated liquid nitrogen, and cross-contamination of sterile liquid nitrogen from infected embryos in naked and closed devices. Additionally, we examined the effects of antibiotic-free media on culture development of infected embryos. The study was a laboratory-based analysis using rabbit as a model. Two experiments were performed to evaluate both cross-infection (liquid nitrogen to embryos) and cross-contamination (embryos to liquid nitrogen) of artificially inoculated  Typhimurium, , , and . Rapid cooling through vitrification was conducted on rabbit embryos, stored for a year, thawed, and cultured. In vivo produced late morulae-early blastocyst stages (72 h) embryos were used (n = 480). Embryos were cultured for 1 h in solutions with and without pathogens. Then, the embryos were vitrified and stored in naked and closed devices for one year in two liquid nitrogen biobanks (one pathogen-free and the other artificially contaminated). Embryos were warmed and cultured for a further 48 h, assessing the development and the presence of microorganism (chromogenic media, scanning electron microscopy). Embryos stored in naked devices in artificially contaminated liquid nitrogen became infected (12.5%), while none of the embryos stored in closed devices were infected. Meanwhile, storage of artificially infected embryos incurred liquid nitrogen biobank contamination (100%). Observations by scanning electron microscopy revealed that all the microorganisms were caught in the surface of embryos after the vitrification-thawed procedure. Nevertheless, embryos cultured in antibiotics and antimycotic medium developed to the hatched blastocyst stage, while artificially infected embryos cultured in antibiotic-free medium failed to develop. In conclusion, our findings support that both cross-contamination and cross-infection during embryo storage in liquid nitrogen biobanks are plausible. So, to ensure biosafety for the cryogenic storage, closed systems that avoid direct contact with liquid nitrogen must be used. Moreover, it seems essential to provide best practice guidelines for the cryogenic preservation and storage of gametes and embryos, to define appropriate quality and risk management procedures.",,,bacteria;closed device;embryo;fungi;microorganisms;naked device;pathogen transmission;vitrification;

Molecular biomarkers measurable in non-invasively collected samples (liquid biopsies) could facilitate screening, as they could have incremental value on early diagnosis of cancer, but could also predict prognosis or monitor treatment response. Although the shift towards biomarkers from liquid biopsies for early cancer detection was initiated some time ago, there are many challenges that hamper the development of such biomarkers. One of these challenges is large-scale validation that requires large prospectively collected biobanks with liquid biopsies. Establishing those biobanks involves several considerations, such as standardization of sample collection, processing and storage within and between biobanks.

Prospective cohort study alongside individual participant meta-analysis of other cohort studies. United Kingdom. Analytical sample of 499 701 people (response rate 5.5%) in analyses in UK Biobank; pooled data from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), including 18 studies and 89 895 people (mean response rate 68%). Both study populations were linked to the same nationwide mortality registries, and the baseline age range was aligned at 40-69 years. Death from cardiovascular disease, selected malignancies, and suicide. To quantify the difference between hazard ratios in the two studies, a ratio of the hazard ratios was used with HSE-SHS as the referent. Risk factor levels and mortality rates were typically more favourable in UK Biobank participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium. For the associations between risk factors and mortality endpoints, however, close agreement was seen between studies. Based on 14 288 deaths during an average of 7.0 years of follow-up in UK Biobank and 7861 deaths over 10 years of mortality surveillance in HSE-SHS, for cardiovascular disease mortality, for instance, the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio for ever having smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.87 to 2.24) in UK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78 to 2.23) in HSE-SHS, yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88 to 1.19). The overall pattern of agreement between studies was essentially unchanged when results were compared separately by sex and when baseline years and censoring dates were aligned.

An online mental health questionnaire was designed for UK Biobank participants to expand its potential. Describe the development, implementation and results of this questionnaire. An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting a patient group. Operational criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and risk states, including lifetime depression, mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic stress and hazardous/harmful alcohol use. A total of 157 366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Participants were aged 45-82 (53% were ≥65 years) and 57% women. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was a common finding, with 24% (37 434) of participants meeting criteria and current hazardous/harmful alcohol use criteria were met by 21% (32 602), whereas other criteria were met by less than 8% of the participants. There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with a high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. The UK Biobank questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed because of selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.",,,Mental health;UK Biobank;alcohol disorders;cohort study;depressive disorders;

Results show that African American participants' health information efficacy was significantly and negatively associated with their need for control over biospecimens and preference for a study-specific model. European American participants' dependency on doctors was a significant and negative predictor of their preference for a study-specific model. Several significant interaction effects, which varied across races, were found with regard to health information efficacy, personal cancer history, need for control, and preference for a study-specific model.

Several general biobank standards exist that can be associated with programs to provide different levels of conformity assessment, including the Canadian Tissue Repository Network (CTRNet) Certification program and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20387 and accreditation bodies. We examined the CTRNet Required Operational Practices (2017) and ISO 20387 (2018), to compare them. Although the organization of each standard is different, both describe a set of discrete requirements (elements or subclauses) that comprise the standards that are contained in sections called chapters (CTRNet) or clauses (ISO). The standards have a similar number of requirements (CTRNet: 362, ISO: 322). To compare these standards, we reclassified the requirements in the ISO standard into 13 categories based on a combination of the chapter headings used in the ISBER and NCI Best Practices that represent important areas of biobanking activity. This categorization of requirements showed that each standard has a different emphasis reflected in different densities of requirements within distinct areas of biobanking. The ISO standard emphasizes Quality Management Systems whereas the CTRNet standard has an even coverage across the full spectrum of biobanking areas, including activities that are relevant to participant enrollment. Nevertheless, ∼60% of the requirements in the CTRNet standard match with those of the ISO standard. We conclude that these two standards have much in common but recommend that individual biobanks consider each standard carefully in the context of the purpose, focus, scale, and scope of their biobank to determine the appropriate standard to be followed.",,,Biological Specimen Banks;Canada;Certification;Humans;Reference Standards;Specimen Handling;biobanking;quality;standards;

The analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquired in the UK Biobank represents an opportunity to screen for AF in a large sub-population in the UK. The main objective of this paper is to assess ten machine-learning methods for automated detection of subjects with AF in the UK Biobank dataset. Six classical machine-learning methods based on support vector machines are proposed and compared with state-of-the-art techniques (including a deep-learning algorithm), and finally a combination of a classical machine-learning and deep learning approaches. Evaluation is carried out on a subset of the UK Biobank dataset, manually annotated by human experts. The combined classical machine-learning and deep learning method achieved an F1 score of 84.8% on the test subset, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.83, which is similar to the inter-observer agreement of two human experts. The level of performance indicates that the automated detection of AF in patients whose data have been stored in a large database, such as the UK Biobank, is possible. Such automated identification of AF patients would enable further investigations aimed at identifying the different phenotypes associated with AF.",,,"Atrial Fibrillation;Big Data;Biological Specimen Banks;Electrocardiography;Humans;Medical Informatics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machine;United Kingdom"

In addition to the traditional biomolecular-based biobanks, there is a growing interest in establishing living biobanks, including organoid biobanks that can collect and store viable and functional tissues and proliferative cell types for long periods of time. An organoid is a three-dimensional cell complex derived by self-organization of small tissue blocks or stem cells, which can recapitulate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of targeted human organs. Publications on brain organoids have increased recently, and several types of brain organoids have been reported to model normal and abnormal neural development, as well as different neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and other neural conditions. Based on the current status of research, more exploration on brain organoids is needed, through technical advancements, to improve the reproducibility and scalability, as well as to decrease the diversity. Moreover, given their natural characteristics, more attention to ethical considerations is needed, considering the extent of maturation and complexity of brain organoids. Living biobanks that are engaged in collecting categories of brain organoids possessing different genetic backgrounds, and with spatial and temporal characteristics, will eventually contribute to the understanding of neural conditions and ultimately facilitate innovative treatment development.",,,"Biological Specimen Banks;Brain;Humans;Models, Biological;Organoids;Phenotype;Specimen Handling;Translational Research, Biomedical;brain organoids;living biobank;neurological disorders"

Moreover, global evidence remains inconclusive about the associations of poultry and fish consumption with diabetes. Therefore we investigated the associations of red meat, poultry and fish intake with incidence of diabetes in a Chinese population. The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank recruited ~512,000 adults (59% women, mean age 51 years) from ten rural and urban areas across China in 2004-2008. At the baseline survey, a validated interviewer-administered laptop-based questionnaire was used to collect information on the consumption frequency of major food groups including red meat, poultry, fish, fresh fruit and several others. During ~9 years of follow-up, 14,931 incidences of new-onset diabetes were recorded among 461,036 participants who had no prior diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or cancer at baseline. Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted HRs for incident diabetes associated with red meat, poultry and fish intake. At baseline, 47.0%, 1.3% and 8.9% of participants reported a regular consumption (i.e. ≥4 days/week) of red meat, poultry and fish, respectively. After adjusting for adiposity and other potential confounders, each 50 g/day increase in red meat and fish intake was associated with 11% (HR 1.11 [95% CI 1.04, 1.20]) and 6% (HR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00, 1.13]) higher risk of incident diabetes, respectively. For both, the associations were more pronounced among men and women from urban areas, with an HR (95% CI) of 1.42 (1.15, 1.74) and 1.18 (1.03, 1.36), respectively, per 50 g/day red meat intake and 1.15 (1.02, 1.30) and 1.11 (1.01, 1.23), respectively, per 50 g/day fish intake. There was no significant association between diabetes and poultry intake, either overall (HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.83, 1.12] per 50 g/day intake) or in specific population subgroups. In Chinese adults, both red meat and fish, but not poultry, intake were positively associated with diabetes risk, particularly among urban participants.

Methods This was a mixed-methods study, including an online survey of Australian biobank administrators and qualitative interviews with survey participants. The survey examined the criteria applied when considering requests to share or network. The interviews explored attitudes and practices regarding sharing and networking. Results Most (90.9%; 30/33) biobanks offered access to their samples and data to others, principally for research (90.6%; 29/32). The most common criteria used to evaluate access requests included ethical oversight (84.8%; 28/33), scientific merit (84.8%; 28/33) and intended use (81.8%; 27/33). Just over two-thirds (69.7%; 23/33) of biobanks participated in Australian networks, and 39.1% (9/23) participated in global networks. Networking took the form of both sharing standardised operating procedures and policies (60.9%) and sharing samples and data (43.5%). Thirteen of the 16 interviewees participated in networks. Motivations for sharing included scientific necessity, sharing expertise and standardising operations and governance. Significant barriers to networking remain, including insufficient resources, inconsistent regulations and procedures, and cultural and political issues to do with the conduct of research. Conclusions Many Australian biobanks are already active participants in various types of global biobanking. If biobanks are to expand and make the most of their involvement in global networks, then important barriers need to be overcome. What is known about the topic? Biobanks that store human tissue and associated data are increasingly forming local, national and global networks. These networks create opportunities for enhancing the utility and sustainability of biobanks, but also raise considerable technical, legal and ethical challenges. What does this paper add? This paper reports findings from a mixed-methods study of Australian biobanks and reveals contemporary practices and perspectives concerning sample and data sharing, as well as local and global networking. It found most Australian biobanks currently take part in these activities. What are the implications for practitioners? Many Australian biobanks are networking in various ways across regional and national borders. A better understanding of current practices and views on significant and emerging issues is relevant to the diverse range of biobank stakeholders involved in any agenda to expand biobank networking, including patients, consumers, clinicians, scientists, policy makers and regulators.",,,Attitude;Australia;Biological Specimen Banks;Humans;Information Dissemination;Publications;
