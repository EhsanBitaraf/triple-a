### Graphistry
Graphistry brings visual graph intelligence to your big or complex data. It automatically transforms your data into interactive, visual maps built for the needs of analysts. Quickly surface relationships between events and entities with less time writing queries or wrangling data. As the first automatically GPU-accelerated platform, harness all of your data without worrying about scale, and pivot on the fly to follow anywhere your investigation leads you. Ideal for everything from security, fraud, and IT investigations to 360Â° views of customers and supply chains to mapping cancer mutations, Graphistry turns the potential of your data into human insight and value.
