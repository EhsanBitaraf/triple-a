                "summary": "Ordered item response models that are in common use can be divided into three\ngroups, cumulative, sequential and adjacent categories model. The derivation\nand motivation of the models is typically based on the assumed presence of\nlatent traits or underlying process models. In the construction frequently\nbinary models play an important role. The objective of this paper is to give\nmotivations for the models and to clarify the role of the binary models for the\nvarious types of ordinal models. It is investigated which binary models are\nincluded in an ordinal model but also how the models can be constructed from a\nsequence of binary models. In all the models one finds a Guttman space\nstructure, which has previously been investigated in particular for the partial\ncredit model. The consideration of the binary models adds to the interpretation\nof model parameters, which is helpful, in particular, in the case of the\npartial credit model, for which interpretation is less straightforward than for\nthe other models. A specific topic that is addressed is the ordering of\nthresholds in the partial credit model because for some researchers reversed\nordering is an anomaly, others disagree. It is argued that the ordering of\nthresholds is not a constitutive element of the partial credit model.",

We\ndemonstrate the use of BMA in model-based clustering for a number of datasets.\nWe show that BMA provides a useful summary of the clustering of observations\nwhile taking model uncertainty into account. Further, we show that BMA in\nconjunction with model-based clustering gives a competitive method for density\nestimation in a multivariate setting.
