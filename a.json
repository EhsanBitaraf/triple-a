The study finds that stronger grip strength is associated with better cognitive functioning, higher life satisfaction, and reduced depression and anxiety symptoms. It also reveals that grey matter volume in subcortical regions and temporal cortices mediates the relationship between grip strength and mental health. The findings may help facilitate the discovery of interventions to mitigate cognitive decline during aging."}
